<em>Summer is playful!</em> The rising temperature boils up the body, and the only solution is in finding a cooler and more exotic place in the world!


Summer and Adventure are two different sides of a coin! Nepal, being an ultimate adventure destination for many decades, is made for summer holidaying. Trekking in the Himalaya is a least favorable choice during summer. Snow is scarce, mountain landscape tends to get darker and overall weather is warmer! There aren&#8217;t many things to do up in the mountain, however, the lower landscapes may offer many other adventure stuffs one can consider undertaking.


Therefore, the most exciting holiday this summer 2015 can only take place&#160;in Nepal (Highly Recommended). Some of the unbeatable summer adventure and holiday experiences can be:


1) Wildlife (Jungle) Safari in Southern Nepal (Terai)
Nepal is geographically rich in variety of ecosystems, creating a perfect wilderness for numerous species of flora and fauna. The southern region of Nepal (Terai) is rich in sub-tropical forests. The denser forests of Terai is home to some of the most exotic animals found in Asia (Few found only in Nepal).


Famous for hunting expeditions <em>(activity preferred by many Royals, British lords of the Raj and nobles, during the turn of 20th century) in their yeste-years</em>, these areas are now reserved as the habitat and breeding centers for rare animals.


Chitwan National Park (932 km&#178;) est. 1973, is the biggest ecological park located in Southern Nepal, followed by Bardia National Park (968 km&#178;) est. 1988, which briefly served as a part of British India. The most fascinating thing here is that they consist of rare species of Royal Bengal Tiger (found mainly in Bengal forests of India-Bangladesh, Thailand and Nepal). Surfing Terai landscape can offer the rarest of the rare chance of spotting these <em>beasts</em>,&#160; well alive and breathing. An experience you won&#8217;t miss sharing with your friends back home.

Other major attractions of Chitwan are; observing the local nomadic tribe <em>(Tharu)&#160;</em>&#160;inhabiting the outskirts of the forests and 30 different species of mammals <em>(One-horned Rhino, Mugger Crocodiles)</em> and over 400 species of birds <em>(Spiny Babbler, Sarus Crane)</em> found in the region.


2) White Water Rafting in Trishuli
Trishuli, originating in Tibet, is a trans boundary river gifted with great rapids, making it one of the most exciting and dangerous white waters in Nepal.


No Doubt, Rafting is one of the most preferred adventure sports in Nepal, mainly because of the challenge involved in it! The river of Trishuli changes its course over the time, demanding mileage and enthusiasm from the rafters. <em>Pirouetting, high sliding and troying</em> are few of the usual techniques used during the rafting. The thrill and adventure generated is equally exhilarating as any other adventure sports found in Nepal.
