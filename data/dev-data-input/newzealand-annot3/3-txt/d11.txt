				Bay of Islands			
			The Bay of Islands is one of the best places to go in New Zealand for fishing, sailing, and other watersports. The Bay of Islands is about three hours by car from Auckland. This gorgeous region is made up of 144 islands between Cape Brett and the Purerua Peninsula.


What's there to do in the Bay of Islands? Get on or in the water! Try scuba diving with Paihia Dive's intro-to-diving course. You will be ferried far out into the bay to explore a whole new underwater world.


Or, get up close and personal with the marine life in the Bay of Islands on a Fullers GreatSights Dolphin Eco Experience. You'll get to view dolphins and whales from the boat and, if conditions allow, swim with wild dolphins.


For accommodations in the Bay of Islands, we recommend spending a night at the historic Duke of Marlborough hotel, which has the distinction of holding the oldest pub license in New Zealand.


Don't leave the Bay of Islands without seeing the Hole in the Rock, an opening in a rock formation that you can sail through when the tide is right.

					Milford Sound, New Zealand				
				Rudyard Kipling called Milford Sound the "eighth wonder of the world," and if you visit this region of New Zealand, you'll see why. Formed by glaciers during the Ice Age, the landscape around Milford Sound still bears evidence of its creation in the form of epic scenery: Cliffs rise from fjords crowned by mountains and waterfalls. 


The best way to see Milford Sound is via boat. Take a sightseeing cruise on the fjord to see waterfalls and wildlife such as dolphins and penguins. Or navigate the waters under your own steam on a kayaking tour.


Once you've experienced the water from the surface, go underneath with a visit to the Milford Discovery Centre and Underwater Observatory. This is the only floating, underwater observatory in New Zealand, and visitors can go more than 30 feet deep (while staying dry) and get 360 degrees of the underwater environment.

					Auckland, New Zealand				
				As both the largest city in New Zealand and its international air-travel hub, Auckland is one of the best places to go in New Zealand. Many international flights arrive in New Zealand through Auckland Airport, which makes it an ideal city from which to start your exploration of New Zealand. 


Spend at least a day or two in Auckland&#226;&#128;&#148;named one of the top 10 cities in the world by Lonely Planet&#226;&#128;&#148;before venturing further afield in New Zealand. Here are our suggestions for what to see and do in Auckland:


Get some culture by visiting one of the many museums in Auckland, such as the Auckland Art Gallery. The Auckland Art Gallery is the largest art institution in New Zealand, featuring more than 15,000 works of historic, modern, and contemporary art.
If the weather is nice, take a stroll through the 185-acre Auckland Domain park. If you're visiting on a Saturday, include a stop at the nearby Parnell Farmers' Market, which sells fresh produce in the morning.
Auckland is also home to a host of multicultural bars and restaurants serving up all types of cuisine, so be sure to dine in downtown Auckland (and go out for a cocktail or two to check out the nightlife).
If you're looking for adventure activities in Auckland, consider the Auckland Bridge Climb. And if you're really brave, try the Auckland Bridge bungee jump.
If you're looking for guided trips in Auckland, book an Auckland City Tour or an America's Cup sailing experience on Waitemata Harbour.

					Waiheke Island, New Zealand				
				Just a little more than 30 minutes by boat from downtown Auckland is Waiheke Island, one of the best places to go in New Zealand. For a small island in the middle of Hauraki Gulf, Waiheke Island sure is home to a lot of vineyards. To sample as many of them as you can on your visit to Waiheke Island, you'll want to find someone else to drive. Our pick is Waiheke Island Wine Tours, whose expert local guides will shuttle you around to three vineyards to sample 14 different wines.


All that wine from the vineyards of Waiheke Island will make you hungry. When it's time to eat, book your lunch or dinner at the Mudbrick Vineyard Restaurant, a gorgeous eatery with sprawling views of the vineyard and the sea. For a really special meal, book the Mudbrick Vineyard Restaurant's tasting menu, a seven-course event with wine pairings.


To get to Waiheke Island, book a Waiheke Island ferry. These are run by Fullers Ferry, SeaLink, and 360 Discovery.


It's definitely worth staying overnight on Waiheke Island, too. We like the Delamore Lodge, one of the best-reviewed Waiheke Island hotels on our sister site TripAdvisor.


Of course, there's more to do on Waiheke Island than just drink wine! Waiheke Island is also famous for its vibrant art community, beaches, forests, and olive groves. We recommend booking a culture tour, scenic flight, or hiking trip while you're there to really see why Waiheke Island is one of the best places to go in New Zealand.

					Christchurch, New Zealand				
				Despite being rocked by four large earthquakes between September 2010 and December 2011, Christchurch has made a true comeback. Visitors to Christchurch will see evidence of the city's rebirth everywhere, including new buildings made out of old shipping containers, such as the aptly named Revival Bar and the Re:START mall. 


Of course, many of Christchurch's original attractions are still standing. One of the best places to visit is the Christchurch Botanic Gardens, a sprawling network of conservatories, walking tracks, and horticultural displays. The gardens also feature some of the largest, tallest, and oldest trees in New Zealand.


Take in the new and the old of Christchurch from above with a journey on the Christchurch Gondola. This cable car lifts you on a scenic ride to the top of Mt. Cavendish.

					White Island, New Zealand				
				White Island is the most active volcano in New Zealand. Get up close and personal with White Island by taking a scenic helicopter ride with Volcanic Air Safaris. Your White Island tour won't be a leisurely stroll: Because this is a very active volcano, you'll have to wear a hard hat and gas mask. You may even see volcanologists monitoring the volcano.


Although the volcano is commonly known as White Island, its full name is Te Puia o Whakaari, a Maori name that translates to "The Dramatic Volcano." The island was first called White Island by Captain Cook in 1769 because every time he sailed near it, it appeared to be covered in a cloud of white steam. (Cook never realized it was a volcano.)


If a helicopter tour of White Island is not your thing, there are a number of other ways to explore the volcano. You can take a boat to White Island or get a bird's-eye view of it on a scenic flight. You can even go scuba diving around White Island for a look at the volcano's underwater vents.

					Queenstown, New Zealand				
				Located on the southwest side of the South Island, Queenstown has a well-deserved reputation as the adventure capital of New Zealand. During the winter and spring months (June to October), Queenstown is known for world-class skiing. Of course, there's plenty to do in Queenstown year-round. Adventure activities such as bungee jumping, skydiving, jet boating, and river rafting will let you experience the region from dizzying heights and at breathtaking speeds. 


Queenstown is also home to the world's highest cliff jump, the Shotover Canyon Swing, where you can hurl yourself off a cliff in a number of different ways&#226;&#128;&#148;including backward or tied to a chair.  


If you haven't lost your appetite (or your lunch) while on these adrenaline-pumping activities, enjoy the dining scene in Queenstown&#226;&#128;&#148;it's one of the best in New Zealand. As locals and tour guides alike will tell you, one of the best places to eat in Queenstown is Fergburger, which CNN says "may be the best burger joint on the planet."

					Te Whakarewarewa Geothermal Valley, New Zealand				
				No list of the best places to go in New Zealand would be complete without mentioning Te Puia, the New Zealand Maori Arts and Crafts Institute located in Rotorua's Te Whakarewarewa Geothermal Valley. At this Maori heritage center, you can get an authentic "steambox" meal prepared using ancient geothermal cooking techniques. You'll also experience a Maori welcome ceremony and traditional song and dance performance. 


The Te Whakarewarewa Geothermal Valley is also home to a number of active geysers, including Pohutu, the largest active geyser in the southern hemisphere. Mud pools are another natural attraction in the geothermal valley: These boiling pools reach temperatures of more than 200 degrees Fahrenheit.

					Waitomo Glowworm Caves, New Zealand				
				The Waitomo Glowworm Caves, naturally illuminated by thousands of glowworms, are among the best places to go in New Zealand&#226;&#128;&#148;and a visit to the caves is one experience you'll be hard-pressed to duplicate anywhere else. You can take a boat ride through the caves to learn about the history and science behind the phenomenon. 


Or, if you really want a unique adventure, try black-water rafting with The Legendary Black Water Rafting Company, which will float you on an inner tube down a subterranean stream. It will be pitch-dark (except for the glowworms), and you'll get to do everything from jumping off waterfalls to rappelling down cave walls. Choose your own adventure when you book the tour.


There are other (non-glowworm) caves in Waitomo, too. Aranui Cave features ancient cave decorations; Ruakuri Cave has an awesome spiral entrance and unique limestone formations&#226;&#128;&#148;and, okay, more glowworms, but in this cave, you can do a walking tour rather than a water-based excursion.

					Franz Josef Glacier, New Zealand				
				You can hike an actual glacier in New Zealand. The Franz Josef Glacier plays host to both guided walks and jaw-dropping helicopter tours. Tours offer everything from ice climbing to a more relaxed hike on the 6.8-mile-long glacier.


Won't you be freezing on top of a giant glacier? Nope! The Franz Josef Glacier receives a lot of sunlight, and temperatures on the ice are usually only a few degrees colder than in the nearby town.


Cap off a day touring the Franz Josef Glacier with a soak in the Glacier Hot Pools. The pools are fed by the waters from the Franz Josef Glacier, and you can use one of the three warm pools or get a private pool.
