 Huia   August 16, 2011  


top ten places in N.Z!!!

If you want to know the top ten places:
 I am a born and breed New Zealand Maori and i can give you the must see, visit, and snap shot places.

1. Cape Reinga
 (I am from the North Island soo i cant confidentally give you advice on how to spend your time up North)
 A great way to start your trip would be from the top of the North Island, this place is the point of New Zealand.
 Some Iwi's (Group of Maori's) believe when you passed away your wairua or soul would travel up thru the North Island and to Cape Reinga and then further to go back to Hiwaiiki (Name of the place Maori people came from before they came to N.Z)
 -Must do:
 QUADS OR HORSE RIDING: Explore NORTH N.Z beaches this way. Its intense, beautiful and much more fun!
 -DONT FORGET TO DO PIPI PICKING(TYPE OF SHELLFISH) OR MUSSEL DIVING!
 PIPI PICKING: SOME beaches you can pipi pick, you wait for the tide to go out and than stick your hands under the sand. You will pick up some pipis!! (please put back small ones &amp; only take what you need)
 *leave them in water over night to spit out the sand &amp; than boil them! Maori's love to get a white loaf put real butter on it and have a pipi sandwhich!!!

2. Auckland City
 See the Sky Tower. Maybe jump off it if your keen
 And difinitly drive along Mission Bay &amp; take a photo of the Water fountain, every new zealander knows the lion water fountain!!
 (Watch out for crazy Auckland drivers lol =)

3. Paeroa
 Paeroa is known for the L&amp;P drink
 Make sure you get a photo infront of the L&amp;P bottle
 And get a Ice-cream &amp; L&amp;P soda sundae or mayb just a drink! lol

4.Taupo
 Taupo is a beautiful Lagoon where some Maori's believe a TANIWHA (WATER MONSTER) Lives!!
 Make sure to do the golf hit, where there is a floating platform and a hole. You get it in, you win $$$ and the feeling of accomplishment!! haha

5. Rotorua
 Now this place smells like EGGS!!
 Soo remember that!!
 Must visit WHAKAREWAREWA! Its a Maori Village or Hometown where Maori's live, do performances and gives you knowledge about their home.
 -Must do:
 *Have a STEAMED HANGI!! (only place you can eat a hangi like that)
 *Visit Polynesian Spa (Most relaxing place where you can get facials, massages and a nice hot dip in all NATURAL spas with an EXZIGUZIT VIEW!!!!!!! YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT!)

6. Queenstown
 This place is &#8220;PUMPING TOWN&#8221; its were all the tourist go!
 Difinitly do the big boat ride (sorry i have forgotten what it is called) lets just say its a fast way to get down the stream!!
 And the view is straight out of LORD OF THE RINGS!
 ENOUGH SAID!

7.Wellington
 Its the capital of New Zealand.
 You have the beehive, where the n.z politics are.
 Te Papa Museum: which i recommend to visit!!
 Weta Cave: If your a huge movie fan.. this place is free! You get too see some amazing talent new zealanders have in alot of block buster movies. And LORD OF THE RINGS!

8. Christchurch
 But at the moment i guess, its a bit unsafe!!

9. Coromandel
 BEAUTIFUL! MUST SEE VIEWS!!

10. Waitangi
 This place is back up in the North Island and basically is the history of New Zealand.

KEY THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR:
 *NEW ZEALAND SHEEP SKIN UG BOOTS
 (pure wool and is the best quality around) it can be found at any Sheep wool factories or shops

*Maori Greenstone (Pounamu)
 Never by one for yourself! If your with your partner buy one for him and get him to buy one for you. Greenstone should always be given in good favour, as Maori's believe it is sacred (tapu) and protects you.

*A steamed Hangi &amp; a Hangi in the ground

*Pipi picking &amp; Kai moana diving (seafood diving)

*Horse riding &amp; Quad riding

*Bungy jumping &amp; Sky diving

This is the best of my knowledge that i can remember doing thru my trips around AOTEAROA (NEW ZEALAND) !!

RECCOMEND: I 100% RECCOMEND DOING THIS BY CAMPERVAN OR CAR!!!! IF YOU DONT YOU MISS OUT ON SOO MUCH BEAUTIFUL THINGS NEW ZEALAND HAS TO OFFER!!!

THEIR IS SOO MUCH TOO SAY AND SEE BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT BY VEHICLE TO CATCH ALL THE PLACES IV MISSED OUT!!

I HOPE IF YOU DO THIS YOU WOULD HAVE AS MUCH FUN AS I DID!! =)
