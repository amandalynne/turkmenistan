The North Island, New Zealand

Northland
The sub-tropical temperatures and the extensive unspoilt coastline make Northland a great place for water activities.&#160; Head up to Tutukaka or Russell for a spot of fishing, or pay a visit to Waitangi and learn about the Treaty that shaped New Zealand.&#160; Soak up the art, creativity, organic farming and alternative thinking which defines the unique culture of Northland.

Auckland
Auckland is New Zealand's largest city and combines urban living with the seaside - you're never more than half an hour away from a beach.&#160; Dubbed the &#8216;city of sails' Aucklanders are big on their boats.&#160; You could take the ferry across to Waiheke Island and tour the wineries, explore one of the many volcanoes in the region, do some surfing at Piha, or check out one of the many restaurants, bars and clubs.

Rotorua
Don't miss the boiling mud pools and squirting geysers which make Rotorua famous – just be prepared for the sulphur smell they give off which can be rather like a toilet on a bad day...&#160; Maori sites are in abundance in Rotorua too so get your dose of culture while you're there, and at the end of the day have a soak in one of the hot pools (just don't get into one that's boiling).

Ruapehu
A must for the ski and snowboard lovers of the world, the Tongariro national park boasts three (sporadically active) volcanic cones Ruapehu, Tongariro and Ngauruhoe.&#160; When the snow has melted the peaks are equally good for hiking.&#160; Base yourself at nearby Ohakune and experience the bars and restaurants at night and some outdoor adventure during the day.

Wellington
Nestled at the bottom of the North Island sits New Zealand's capital, Wellington.&#160; As well as the visually stimulating surroundings characteristic of all the regions, this city is big on the arts and culture.&#160; Head to the Te Papa museum with big interactive displays to get a dose of the past, and at night stay up with the city to enjoy bars, restaurants, live music and performances.


The South Island, New Zealand

Nelson
The sunniest region in New Zealand, head to Nelson and enjoy the great beaches and national parks, explore the vineyards, check out the art galleries and generally be adventurous!&#160; Go sea kayaking, rock climbing, white water rafting, mountain biking, sailing, horse trekking, four-wheel biking and skydiving to name just a few activities on offer.

Marlborough
Head to a Marlborough vineyard, discover the history or check out the wildlife.&#160; The nature lover will revel in the dolphins, seals, tiny blue penguins, native bellbird, tui and other birdlife, throughout the region and within bird and sealife sanctuaries.

Canterbury
Canterbury is home to the highest point in New Zealand, Mt Cook, which stands at 3,754 m, while at the other end of the scale there are deep submarine trenches off the coast of Kaikoura that are home to whales, dolphins and seals.&#160; Christchurch and Timaru are the regions cities, and you'll find the colonial heritage well-preserved.

Queenstown
Queenstown will really rock your socks off – whether you're a ski or snowboard bunny wanting to take advantage of some of the pristine snowfields, a bungee jumping adrenaline junkie, or just a sightseer happy to soak up the amazing scenery – this place has it all.&#160; Don't miss the Queenstown Winter Festival – 10 days of carnage known as the &#8216;Southern Hemisphere's Ultimate Winter Party'.

Southland
Visit Invercargill to admire the Victorian and Edwardian buildings which sprang up to accommodate the early British settlers, then head to Bluff and sample some of the regions famous oysters.&#160; Keen to see a kiwi in its natural habitat?&#160; Jump on the ferry to Stewart Island.
