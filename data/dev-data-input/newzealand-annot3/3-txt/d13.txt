								New Zealand is a beautiful country with a splendid landscape which varies from mountains to forests, volcanoes and beaches. Its breath taking scenery itself is a great tourist attraction as you will see in this list of Top 10 Tourist Attractions in New Zealand. Its government should be hailed for conserving New Zealand's natural environment as well as its culture. New Zealand is not merely a place for nature lovers but it offers something for everyone; from 4WD, canoeing and kayaking to diving, gliding, jet-skiing, glacier hiking, hunting, whale watching, and bungee jumping. New Zealand is not only a great attraction for international tourists but it also pulls local tourists towards itself. A lot of its revenue comes from its tourist industry, around NZ$15 Billion. The United Kingdom's newspaper, The Telegraph (in November, 2012), named New Zealand as the best country in the World to visit during holidays and we have declared it the safest country to live in 2013. It was difficult to choose only ten places amongst so many wonderful attractions but nevertheless, we have come up with this list of top 10 places that you must see during your visit to New Zealand to thoroughly enjoy its beauty.
