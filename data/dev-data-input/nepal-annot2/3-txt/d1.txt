                Temple, sacred to Hindus and Buddhists; and Maju Deval, a Shiva 
                temple built in 1690 that offers great views and has become a 
                popular meeting place. Many adventure tours can be arranged from 
                Kathmandu.

                crafts and traditions. Time your visit for mid-April and you can 
                celebrate Bisket Jatra (the Nepali New Year) in Bhaktapur, named 
                by Lonely Planet as one of the world&#146;s best festivals. Bhaktapur 
                is one of the three sacred cities in the Kathmandu Valley, the 
                others being Kathmandu and Patan.

            
              World&#146;s 
                Highest Gig


              Music4children founder Oz Bayldon is preparing to lead a group 
                of music loving adventurers up Nepal's Mera Peak to make musical 
                history, reclaim a spot in the record books, and raise enough 
                funds to support an orphanage for two years. Both performers and 
                audience members are needed to insure a new record and meet the 
                organization's fundraising goals. Call Incredible Adventures 800-644-7382 
                for more information.

            
              Patan


              Known by art lovers for it&#146;s carvings of wood and stone, architecture, 
                dozens of temples and monuments. The Palace of the Malla Kings 
                and Patan Durbar Square are two of the highlights of a visit to 
                Patan. Traditional carpets may be purchased at the Tibetan Refugee 
                Camp on the edge of town. 

            
              Pokhara


              The end point for the Annapurna Circuit Trek is touristy but 
                in a spectacular setting. There are lots of trails to follow but 
                don&#146;t miss the World Peace Pagoda or the International Mountain 
                Museum while you&#146;re there.

            
              Namche 
                Bazaar


              The last stop before Everest Base Camp. Namche is a busy working 
                tourist town with bakeries, convenience stores and hotels. You&#146;ll 
                catch more than a glimpse of Sherpa life as well as visitors from 
                all over the globe.

            
              Lukla


              A popular stop for visitors to the Himalayas. There are lodges 
                and shops providing trail supplies. For most trekkers Lukla is

                between Lukla and Kathmandu in good weather.

            
              Syangboche


              This is the closest airstrip to Mt Everest and is not licensed 
                for commercial flights; few facilities are available but it&#146;s 
                important in delivery of emergency needs to base camp.

            
              Phakding


              Within Sagarmatha National Park, most trekkers know Phakding 
                as a welcome lunch stop between Lukla and Namche. In the center 
                of town is a 16th centure Sherpa monastery. Comfortable guest 
                houses can be found here as well.
