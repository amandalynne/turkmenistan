    Everest, called Sagarmatha in Nepali language, located in the Khumbu region
    of east Nepal. The region includes upper catchments area of the Dudha Koshi
    and Bhote Koshi rivers. The area is largely composed of the rugged terrain
    and gorges of the high Himalayas ranging from 5,800m to the top of the world
    Mt. Everest (8,848m).

     
    Annapurna Range 

     Starting point to the most astonishing treks to Annapurna Base Camp,
    Annapurna Range is rightly called the 'Range of the Gods'. A blissful site,
    the Range is a natural amphitheater ringed by giant, heavenly treks like
    Annapurna 1, Glacier Dome, Gangapurna, Fang and the fishtail peak of
    Machhapuchhare. With several peaks ranging above 7000 meters, the experience
    is indeed thrilling. 

     
    UNESCO World Heritage Sites

    Pashupatinath Temple
    

     The magnificent temple of Lord Pashupatinath, about 5 kms north-east of
    Kathmandu, is situated amidst many other temples on the right bank of the
    river Bagmati. Pashupatinath Temple is considered to be the holiest Hindu
    Pilgrimage site in Nepal. Dedicated to Hindu Lord Shiva, the shrines and
    temples of Pashupatinath attract thousands of visitors from within and
    outside the country every year. This wooded ravine near the golf course and
    airport is considered to be one of the abodes of Lord Shiva. 

     
    Royal Chitwan
      National Park 

     Royal Chitwan National Park (RCNP) has long been one of the country's
    treasures of natural wonders. The park is situated in south central Nepal,
    covering 932 sq. km. in the subtropical lowlands of the inner Terai. The
    area comprising the Tikauli forest - from Rapti river to the foothills of
    the Mahabharat (place) - extends over an area of 175 sq. km. The area was
    gazetted as the country's first national park in 1973. Recognizing its
    unique ecosystems of international significance, UNESCO declared RCNP a
    World Heritage Site in 1984.

     
    Changunarayan Temple

     This impressive double roofed Changu Narayan Temple is said to be the most
    ancient Vishnu temple in the Kathmandu Valley. The original temple was built
    around the 4th century. The present pagoda-style temple was rebuilt in 1702
    after it was destroyed by fire. It is located in a beautiful peaceful
    location, 4km north of Bhaktapur, on a hill top in the east side of the
    Valley. The temple is UNESCO listed World Heritage site. 

     
    Bhaktapur Durbar
      square 

     Kathmandu's Durbar Square was built primarily in the 16th and 17th
    centuries. It contains a royal palace (a 'durbar') and many temples built in
    the traditional Newar, pagoda style. The golden gate, entrance to the Durbar
    Square is a delight to the eyes, for an architectural beauty like this is
    hard to discover. But what lies inside will change your definition of
    beauty... the beauty of this UNESCO listed World heritage site surpasses
    words!

     
    Kathmandu Durbar
      Square 

     Listed as one of the eight Cultural World Heritage site by UNESCO,
    Kathmandu Durbar Square is a cluster of ancient temples, palaces, courtyards
    and streets that date back to the 12th and 18th centuries. The square is
    known to be the social, religious and urban focal point of the Capital City. 

     
    Golden Gate

     The strikingly beautiful Golden Gate is Nepal's pride. The gate is
    embellished with precious stones and is of great religious ands historical
    importance. The door is royal in built and structure and surmounted by the
    figure of Kali and Garuda. It is believed that the golden gate is two
    heavenly nymphs. The architecture and unsurpassable beauty of the gate
    enamors the tourists. 

     
    Buddhist/Hindu/Jain Site/ Architectural Site 

    Bodhnath Stupa

     Bodhnath Stupa is a bastion of Tibetan culture in the heart of the
    Kathmandu valley. Energized by the arrival of thousands of Tibetans after
    the 1959 Chinese invasion, the temple has become one of the most important
    centers of Tibetan Buddhism. Bodhnath is the largest stupa in Nepal and was
    probably built in the 14th century after the Mughal invasions. From the air
    it looks like a giant Mandala, or diagram of the Buddhist cosmos.

     
    Syambunath

     Known as the monkey temple, Syambhunath has remained substantially
    unchanged since the 14th century. An appreciation of the stupa is best
    gained by proceeding around it in a clockwise direction. As people walk
    round while praying, wheels fixed to the balustrade are set in motion.

     
    Hanuman Dhoka 

     Hanuman Dhoka is the former Royal Palace of the Malla kings and
    sequentially of the Shah dynasty. Several complexes, taking up about five
    acres, are connected together. Outside the palace is a stone inscription
    stationed by the late King Pratap Malla. The inscription has matter written
    on it in 15 different languages. It is said that if someone reads the
    inscription, then milk would gush out from the middle of it. Hanuman's
    statue, dressed in a red cloak, placed outside the darbar, is an object of
    devotion.
