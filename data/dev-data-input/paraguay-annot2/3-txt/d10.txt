Although the country does not have a highly developed tourism industry, you can find plenty of accommodations in the main cities, which are linked by a good road system. Paraguay offers a range of tourist activities, including ecotourism, adventure activities and cultural trips.

 
  Cities Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay, is the gateway to the Gran Chaco region. The downtown area is characterized by shady plazas lined with colonial and beaux-arts buildings, modern shopping malls, international eateries and chic clubs. Attractions include the Metropolitan Cathedral, the botanical garden and zoo, and the Palacio de Lopez. Lake Ypacarai, just outside the city, boasts a lovely, sandy beach at San Bernadino. Concepcion, Paraguay's second city, has a wealth of modern structures, because many original buildings were destroyed by earthquakes. The city is laid out in attractive squares with pedestrian shopping malls, restaurants, bars and clubs, and is renowned for its annual carnival.

 
  Museums Paraguay's cities have a number of small museums, but the Museo del Barro (museodelbarro.org; Spanish language) is one of the most notable. Its huge collection of classical and contemporary artworks includes paintings, ceramics, statues, furniture and lacework. The Jakob Unger Museum in the Mennonite community of Filadelfia (fernheim.com.py; Spanish language) is an ethnographic and natural history museum, with the ground floor dedicated to Mennonite history and the upper area to the flora and fauna of Gran Chaco.

 
  Eco-Tours Gran Chaco is a vast area of savanna, scrubland, dry forest and wet marshes that occupies the entire western half of Paraguay. It contains several nature reserves, including Medanos National Park and Defensores del Chaco National Park. You can visit independently and camp overnight, or take an organized tour to see wildlife including jaguar, puma, tapir, the rare Chaco peccary, giant anteaters and night monkeys, as well as more than 500 species of birds. Fauna Paraguay (faunaparaguay.com) runs wildlife and bird-watching tours around the country, and a volunteer vacation program where you can help with conservation projects. Take a trip through the treetops at Mbatovi Eco Reserve (mbatovi.com.py; Spanish language) via rope bridges and zip lines, or take a guided nature hike along the forest paths.

 
  Sightseeing Two of Paraguay's best-known attractions are the 17th-century Jesuit missions of Trinidad and Jesus, UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Visitors can take an overnight trip from Encarnacion with Vip's Tour (vipstour.com; Spanish language). Other historic sites include the fort of San Carlos, near Vallemi; Fort Olimpo on the banks of the River Paraguay; and the petroglyphs at Cerro Guazu and Tacuati. The Iguazo Falls, outside Ciudad del Este, are a must-see, with 250 cascades. The Itaipu Dam near Concepcion is one of the largest in the world.

 
  Stay at a Ranch Estancia Aventura (estancia-aventura.com), in the Cordillera Mountains, lies approximately an hour's drive from Asuncion. You can go horseback riding with the cowboys, then relax by the pool, play a game of tennis or take a dip in the lake. The comfortable bungalow accommodations sleep six people.
