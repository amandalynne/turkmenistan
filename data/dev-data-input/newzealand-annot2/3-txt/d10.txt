Aotearoa, New Zealand: The land of the Long White Cloud. We love calling this country home, and spend our weekends and holidays exploring it. From our travels, we&#8217;ve put together some of our favourite top New Zealand attractions. Enjoy, and be inspired!


Tane Mahuta
Standing sentinel over Northland&#8217;s Waipoua Forest, Tane Mahuta started off as a tiny seedling over 2000 years ago and is now the largest of all Kauri Trees in New Zealand. Located within the forest only five minutes from the main road, there is no excuse not to take the short stroll to see &#8216;The Lord of the Forest&#8217; with your own eyes. With a diameter of 4.4m you will need approximately three people to be able to hug Tane&#8217;s massive trunk.


Swimming with dolphins in Bay of Islands
Swimming with dolphins has got to be a bucket-list experience. The sheltered waters of Northland&#8217;s Bay of Islands are home to many playful pods eager to show off their impressive tricks. The best and safest way to experience these inquisitive creatures in their natural habitat is to take a professional tour, and, if the conditions are right, you&#8217;ll be able to jump in the sea with them.


Wai-O-Tapu Thermal Park, Rotorua
Meticulously carved out by volcanic activity in the Central North Island, Wai-O-Tapu is New Zealand's&#160;most diverse and colourful geothermal wonderland. Wander past thundering geysers, bubbling mud pools and incredible silica terraces &#8211; it&#8217;s like a different world.


Interislander Ferry &#8211; Cook Strait
As far as public transport goes, the Interislander Ferry is an awesome example of New Zealand&#8217;s pure environment. Serving its purpose, the Interisland Ferry delivers you across the Cook Strait and&#160;through the Queen Charlotte Sound on what could definitely be labelled one of the most spectacular ferry crossings in the world.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Fox Glacier &amp; Franz Josef Glacier
Part of a UNESCO World Heritage area and two of New Zealand&#8217;s top attractions, the ancient ice rivers of Fox Glacier and Franz Josef Glacier are some of the most convenient in the world to reach. Don&#8217;t forget your camera!


Punakaiki Pancake Rocks
Nature started carving this masterpiece over 30 million years ago. Over this time, through seismic activity and environmental wear, giant stacks of pancake-shaped limestone formed and, as the tide makes its ascent, the sea bursts through vertical blow holes putting on a striking display the West Coast&#8217;s raw beauty.


Milford Sound
We&#8217;ve saved the best for last. Even a veteran traveler will be filled with awe as they cruise the dark waters of Milford Sound. Brimming with forest-covered vertical cliffs, cascading waterfalls and a bustling marine-life, Milford Sound showcases the best of New Zealand&#8217;s pristine scenery &#8211; the most unforgettable way to experience this place is by a combination of coach, boat cruise and air.


Inspired by our list of top New Zealand attractions? Want to experience them all for yourself? Our MoaTrek Kakapo Tour visits all of these places, and more. You&#8217;ll travel North to South in a small group of 18 people or less, led by a friendly &amp; experienced Kiwi Guide. Get in touch &#8211; we&#8217;d love to hear from you!

&#8220;This tour has been fantastic. I have learnt so much about beautiful New Zealand. Matt our guide has such extensive knowledge of the country and its history and shares it expertly. I particularly enjoyed learning about the rain forest, bush and glaciers. The tour is very well organised and professionally run with so many more activities and sights than I expected. The highlights for me have been the catamaran, Milford Sound and the plane ride back, the Tasman Glacier lake cruise and the Dart River Jet Boat. Thank you Matt for making things run smoothly, being so patient and helpful and most of all making it fun.
