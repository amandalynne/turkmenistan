 

A n essential guide to the best things to do and attractions in New Zealand, including skydiving in Taupo, hiking the Tongariro Alpine Crossing, swimming with dolphins in Kaikoura, and jumping from AJ Hackett&#226;&#128;&#153;s Kawarau Bridge Bungee. By Sarah Bennett and Lee Slater, Telegraph Travel's New Zealand experts. Zoom in on the map for what to see and do.


Top things to do
New Zealand&#226;&#128;&#153;s relatively small size means that many of the country&#226;&#128;&#153;s natural wonders can be seen without having to travel vast distances.


The lower half of the South Island possesses serious wow factor. The high point is Aoraki/Mount Cook (1), around which are a series of extraordinarily blue glacial lakes including Tekapo (2), set amidst the golden tussock of Mackenzie Country.


Further south are Queenstown (3), Wanaka (4) and Te Anau (5) - a trio of pretty lake towns serving as gateways to such postcard stars as Milford (6) and Doubtful Sounds, and Glenorchy.


The North Island has a particularly thick concentration of bedazzling scenes around volcanic Tongariro National Park (7), star of the<em> Lord Of The Rings</em> film. Rotorua&#226;&#128;&#153;s (8) steamy, geothermal spectacles are also highly memorable.

Wildlife
Many remarkable creatures can be encountered in the wild. The rare kiwi, however, will mostly be seen in captivity at reserves like Pukaha Mount Bruce (06 375 8004; pukaha.org.nz), also home to the endearing tuatara, an ancient reptile.


Kaikoura (9) is renowned for its resident sperm whales and other leviathan species that visit in winter. View them on a Whale Watch (0800 655 121; whalewatch.co.nz) boat tour. Spot or even frolic with fur seals on Kaikoura&#226;&#128;&#153;s Seal Swim (0800 732 579; sealswimkaikoura.co.nz) or Kayak Tour (0800 452 456; kaikourakayaks.co.nz).


Dolphin swims are offered by Picton&#226;&#128;&#153;s Dolphin Watch Ecotours (10) (03 573 8040; dolphinswimming.co.nz) and Akaroa&#226;&#128;&#153;s Black Cat Cruises (0800 937 946; blackcat.co.nz), amongst others.


New Zealand is regularly touted as the seabird capital of the world. One of the world's biggest seabirds can be viewed at Otago Peninsula&#226;&#128;&#153;s Royal Albatross Centre (11) (03 478 0499; albatross.org.nz). Penguins can be seen nearby at Penguin Place (03 478 0286; penguinplace.co.nz) or Oamaru&#226;&#128;&#153;s Blue Penguin Colony (03 433 1195; penguins.co.nz).

Hiking
New Zealand is a walkers&#226;&#128;&#153; paradise, with trails for beginner and advanced hikers alike, many through the country's 14 national parks. Trails are generally well maintained and signposted, with detailed maps and information available online and in print from the Department of Conservation (DOC) (doc.govt.nz).


Revealing national parks in all their splendour, DOC&#226;&#128;&#153;s nine Great Walks (greatwalks.co.nz) offer multi-day adventures ranging from a relaxing amble around the Abel Tasman coastline (12), to the gut-busting Milford Track mountain pass.


National parks also offer varied day hikes such as those around Tongariro&#226;&#128;&#153;s volcanoes. Its challenging Alpine Crossing is widely lauded as the country&#226;&#128;&#153;s best one-day adventure.


Hundreds of other forest parks and scenic reserves boast remarkably diverse hikes &#226;&#128;&#147;&#160;such as Oparara&#226;&#128;&#153;s limestone forest, Karangahake&#226;&#128;&#153;s (13) relic-strewn gorge, and the otherworldly dunes of Golden Bay&#226;&#128;&#153;s Farewell Spit.

Cycling
New Zealand has seen such an explosion in off-road cycling it is hard to keep up with new trails. Fortunately, well-situated bike hire and shuttles make them easy to find and explore.


The 22 scenic rides within the New Zealand Cycle Trail network (nzcycletrail.com) are mostly graded easy to medium, so even the rustiest of riders will find something to stretch their legs on.


Tasman&#226;&#128;&#153;s Great Taste Trail and the Hawke&#226;&#128;&#153;s Bay Trails offer mostly flat, easy rides blending scenery with food, wine and other attractions. Fascinating industrial history is on show on the Hauraki Rail Trail and Ohakune Old Coach Road. Those looking for epic landscapes are spoilt for choice, but we recommend the West Coast Wilderness Trail, Alps to Ocean and the Queenstown Trails.

Adrenaline
New Zealand is adrenaline junkie heaven. AJ Hackett&#226;&#128;&#153;s original Kawarau Bridge Bungy (0800 286 4958; bungy.co.nz) is the classic, but head to Hackett&#226;&#128;&#153;s nearby Nevis for the country&#226;&#128;&#153;s loftiest bungee (143m) and thrilling swing. Queenstown has plenty of other hair-raising activities, including paragliding, skydiving, and jet boating.


Taupo&#226;&#128;&#153;s Tandem Skydiving (14) (0800 826 336; taupotandemskydiving.com) often rates as the nation&#226;&#128;&#153;s best. Close by is white-water rafting with Tongariro River Rafting (20) (0800 101 024; trr.co.nz), and zipline Canopy Tours (21) (0800 226 679; canopytours.co.nz) and Ogo zorb (22) (0800 646 768; ogo.co.nz) in Rotorua.


In Motueka (15), thrill-seekers can jump with the lovely folks of Abel Tasman Skydive (0800 422 899; skydive.co.nz), but we also highly recommend Abel Tasman Canyons (0800 863 472; abeltasmancanyons.co.nz) for anyone with reasonable fitness and water skills. Those possessing both should also consider heading north to Waitomo Caves (16) to embark on a 'Legendary Blackwater Rafting' trip (0800 456 922; waitomo.com/black-water-rafting).


Before you take the plunge, check the exclusions of your travel insurance policy: some don't cover adventure activities including bungee jumping, skydiving and rafting.

Soft adventure
Scenic flights are an effortless way to get amongst the majestic scenery. Aoraki/Mt Cook up close is the classic aerial tour, taking off from both the Mt Cook side and the glacier townships out west. Flying above the Fox (17) and Franz Josef (18) glaciers is an eye-popping bonus.


Rugged landscapes can be explored on 4WD trips. Marlborough&#226;&#128;&#153;s Molesworth Tours (03 572 8025; molesworthtours.co.nz) take travellers deep into high country. Even edgier is the Skipper&#226;&#128;&#153;s Canyon escapade with Queenstown-based Nomad Safaris (0800 688 222; nomadsafaris.co.nz).


Welcoming, well-kept golf courses are spread throughout the country. Among the finest are Hawke&#226;&#128;&#153;s Bay&#226;&#128;&#153;s Cape Kidnappers (28) (06 873 1018; capekidnappers.com), sculpted into a dramatic headland, and golf-obsessed Queenstown&#226;&#128;&#153;s The Hills (29) (03 409 8290; thehills.co.nz), featuring striking sculptures and backed by alpine scenery.

Maori culture
For an introduction to Maori history and culture, visit exhibitions in Auckland Museum and Wellington&#226;&#128;&#153;s Te Papa Tongarewa, which offer insights into the great migrations and settlement in Aotearoa &#226;&#128;&#147;&#160;&#226;&#128;&#152;the land of the long white cloud&#226;&#128;&#153;. Many more <em>taonga </em>(treasures) are located in smaller museums throughout the country.


Carving, weaving and tattooing are common Maori art forms, as are powerful physical performances combining <em>waita </em>(singing) and <em>kapa haka </em>(dance). In Rotorua (8), visitors can attend concerts at Whakarewarewa (07 349 3463; whakarewarewa.com) and Te Puia (0800 837 842; tepuia.com), historic reserves preserving Maori culture amongst hot springs, bubbling mud and geysers.

Gourmet
Foodies will find plenty of tasty treats on their travels, as New Zealand&#226;&#128;&#153;s larder is packed with excellent, exciting ingredients.


Fresh, seasonal produce &#226;&#128;&#147; such as Motueka apples, Central Otago stone fruit and West Coast whitebait &#226;&#128;&#147; is best when plucked straight from a roadside stall or Farmers Market (farmersmarkets.org.nz). These and other regional specialities are also championed in a raft of festivals, such as Hokitika&#226;&#128;&#153;s Wild Foods (wildfoods.co.nz), Invercargill&#226;&#128;&#153;s (19) Bluff Oyster (bluffoysterfest.co.nz) and Ohakune&#226;&#128;&#153;s Carrot Carnival (carrotcarnival.org.nz).


The hottest gastronomical hubs are Auckland (20) and Wellington (21), where high-profile chefs mirror the global trend towards casual dining, shared plates and championing local producers. Ethnic cuisines also feature highly, particularly in larger cities. One constant, nationwide, is fantastic caf&#195;&#169;s, serving fine espresso and scrumptious home-baking. Meat pies, cakes and biscuits are a beloved tradition.

Wine trails
Vineyards can be found blanketing almost every region, with tasting rooms, restaurants, festivals and tours (many by bicycle) offering opportunities to meet the winemakers.


Marlborough (22) (wine-marlborough.co.nz) produces around three quarters of New Zealand&#226;&#128;&#153;s wine, and while its zingy sauvignon blanc is a worldwide favourite, luxurious pinot noir, fab fizz and riesling are also notable. The region is wine-trail heaven, with around 40 cellar doors and many great restaurants, set amidst picturesque valleys. The annual Marborough Wine &amp; Food (wine-marlborough-festival.co.nz) festival is a bacchanalian extravaganza.


There&#226;&#128;&#153;s plenty more tastings and tours across diverse terroir (nzwine.com). Central Otago (23) is a major highlight for its scenery and seductive pinot noir. Other indulgent regions include Hawkes Bay, Waiheke Island, Gisborne (24), and Martinborough &#226;&#128;&#147; location of Toast (toastmartinborough.co.nz), the most fun wine festival, spread throughout the vines.

Middle Earth
New Zealand is synonymous with Middle Earth, thanks largely to Peter Jackson, the director who filmed the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> and <em>Hobbit</em> trilogies in some of its most magical settings.


Tongariro National Park (doc.govt.nz) stole some of the biggest scenes, with Mt. Ngauruhoe (25) standing in for Mt Doom. The drama can be reimagined on the hiking trails, starting from the Tongariro's visitor centre. Also on the North Island, Hobbiton (26) (hobbitontours.com) visitors can explore the Shire&#226;&#128;&#153;s film sets, while Wellington&#226;&#128;&#153;s Weta Cave Workshop Tour (wetaworkshop.com) opens the window into the world of the films&#226;&#128;&#153; prop-making team.


Epic alpine landscapes around Queenstown were also hotbeds of action in the films, with Lothlorien, the Ford of Bruinen and Gladden Fields all easily reached from the town.


Tourism New Zealand&#226;&#128;&#153;s website (newzealand.com/int/home-of-middle-earth) has information on all Middle Earth filming locations.
