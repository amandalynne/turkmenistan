				Whatever you want to do, from an incredible Kenya safari to a challenging climb, the country has a huge variety of wonders and Kenya attractions to take your breath away.


&#160;


To help you plan your own adventure, we&#8217;ve put our heads together and agreed on our five favourite places to visit in Kenya. Take a look to see what this unique destination has to offer.


&#160;


&#160;


5. Mount Kenya&#160; 


&#160;


Located in the heart of central Kenya, this giant edifice rises to 5,199m - an impressive 17,057 feet - above sea level. It&#8217;s by far the tallest mountain in Kenya and the second-highest in Africa, after Mount Kilimanjaro. One of Kenya&#8217;s most iconic and popular attractions, this ancient volcano has been eroded by ice for thousands of years to produce incredible chasms, jagged peaks and waterfalls across its surface.&#160;


&#160;


First scaled in 1899, it definitely presents a worthy challenge to all avid climbers. There are several different routes ranging from a relatively easy hike to a challenging climb &#8211; accompanied by trained and capable guides. The north side is best tackled in August and September, whilst the south face is easily navigable around January or February.


&#160; 


But Mount Kenya is not just about the climb and the incredible views, or the varied geological formations, glaciers and diverse vegetation; the Mount Kenya National Park is home to an amazing diversity of wildlife and includes some unusual and rare species - look out for:


&#160;


Water Buck


Tree Hyrax


Monkeys and Baboons


Elephant


Rhino


Buffalo and many more!


&#160;

&#160;


&#160;


4. The Great Rift Valley


&#160;


This spectacular geological wonder encompasses a wealth of Kenyan attractions that you just have to see. Above ground and below the ocean, the Great Rift Valley runs from Northern Syria to Central Mozambique - a distance of around 3,000 miles. Within Kenya, the Valley is a dramatic sight; home to around an incredible 12 volcanoes and 7 lakes, more than enough to thrill even the most jaded traveller. There is a great concentration of game parks, lodges and hotels, making this the ideal focus for a truly memorable Kenyan safari. One of the major Kenya attractions here is Lake Nakuru - famous for its fabulous flamingos and an ideal spot for bird watching.


&#160;


Moving further up the valley, you arrive at Lake Bogoria - Kenya&#8217;s version of the Yellowstone Park - with geysers that regularly erupt sending columns of water 5 metres into the air! For the birdwatchers, Bogoria is also the unlikely home to one of the world&#8217;s largest populations of flamingos - a bewitchingly colourful spectacle in such a rugged region. Carry on your journey to the marvellous Lake Turkana, the largest permanent desert lake in the world, and probably the most unique of the Kenyan lakes. You have to see it to appreciate its special beauty.


&#160;


From lakes to gorges! Movie buffs will recognise the setting for the Lion King and Lara Croft movies when they visit Hell&#8217;s Gate National Park to explore the awe-inspiring Ol Njorowa gorge. This 24 km ravine is lined with sheer cliff faces and a thermal spring-fed river that runs along its floor &#8211; there are also several hot and cold waterfalls en route!&#160;


&#160;


Feeling energetic? Have a go at climbing Mount Longonot. A gentle ascent of 3.1km is achievable for most enthusiastic walkers; it&#8217;s the perfect opportunity to claim some bragging rights by climbing an active volcano. But don&#8217;t worry - the last recorded eruption is believed to have been in the mid 19th century.


&#160;


With all of these incredible attractions to enjoy, there is so much to marvel at in any visit to the Great Rift Valley.


&#160; 


&#160;


3. Amboseli National Park


&#160;


Nicknamed the &#8220;Land of the Giants&#8221;, Amboseli is where you will come face to face with the largest land animal, the African Elephant, as they leisurely graze on the plains with Mount Kilimanjaro as a unique backdrop! Weighing in at anything up to six tonnes and standing 4 metres high, the opportunity to observe a full herd&#160;is a rare and overwhelming experience. The park is the permanent residence of over 900 of these graceful creatures &#8211;&#160;and has become internationally acclaimed as the perfect place to observe the intricacies of their behaviour. The rest of the Big Five are also equally at home at Amboseli - you will get to see lions, buffalo, leopards and even the critically endangered black rhino.


&#160;


Just 160 miles from buzz and activity of Nairobi, the tranquil atmosphere and low-lying nature of the landscape ensures that Amboseli provides you with a perfectly unobstructed view of the animals - ensuring both great game viewing and marvellous photo opportunities. Amboseli is also good for bird watching, with over 400 species to discover.&#160;


&#160;


The Park is situated in a dry area that receives very little rain. However, streams from Mount Kilimanjaro surface through the porous soil of the park and create an oasis of swampy wetlands; it&#8217;s this stark contrast between the lush green of the park and the dry and dusty surroundings that give&#160;the park its startling beauty.


&#160;


The view of Mount Kilimanjaro, the tallest free-standing mountain in the world, is what great postcards are made of; get your stunning photos of the mountain at dawn and dusk, when the clouds have lifted and the mountain is at its best.


&#160; 


&#160;


2. Mombasa


&#160;


With a population of around one million people, Mombasa is Kenya&#8217;s lively second city and is a great place to explore for some fun in the sun, before or after your Kenyan Safari experience. History buffs will enjoy exploring the historical sites such as the Gedi ruins and Fort Jesus - the story of Mombasa is one of prosperous trade and dramatic conflict. For those who seek a calmer pace of life, it&#8217;s the perfect place to relax and soak up the African sun; there are many beautiful beaches to choose from. The warm azure waters of the Indian ocean are just waiting to entice you in&#160;while the palm tree-lined beaches are a stunning spot for relaxation. For those who enjoy exploring below the surface, there is an excellent off-shore reef running the full length of the Kenyan coast. Go snorkeling or scuba diving from a traditional dhow, or you can visit the Watamu Marine Park to see a huge diversity of marine life.


&#160;


Whether you are travelling in style or on a shoestring budget, the Mombasa experience promises to be an exciting and luxurious addition to your Kenyan safari adventure.


&#160; 


&#160;


1. Maasai Mara Game Reserve&#160; 


&#160;


The home of the new Seventh Wonder of the World, the Great Migration, the astounding Masai Mara National Reserve undoubtedly deserves to the number one unmissable sight in Kenya! The reserve has rightfully earned its place as the most visited destination in the country - the Mara remains the embodiment of what the Kenyan safari experience is all about! This diverse habitat stretches across an incredible 1,510 sq. km of southwestern Kenya. It&#8217;s the ideal spot to discover prides of lions lying under the trees, roaming herds of elephants and even spot one or two black rhinos and buffaloes &#8211; this is the unique variety and insight that make Kenyan safaris a truly unforgettable journey into the natural world. &#160;


&#160; 


The reserve is home to all the Big Five and numerous other species of wildlife including hundreds of bird varieties. Of course, the star attraction of the Mara is the Great Migration; watch on as millions of wildebeests make their way from the Serengeti in Tanzania, across the Mara River to the Kenyan side. The size of the migration - and the scale of this dramatic landscape - can be difficult to appreciate, so why not take a hot air balloon ride and enjoy a stunning new perspective on this incredible event? You&#8217;ll never forget it!


&#160;

					It is an amazing blog for me because I love to read about the attractions of wonderful regions. I know that Kenya is the place which has the home of the breathtaking views and attractions. I have been there twice a time in my life and there I explored its several places that encompasses the beautiful features. The most recent visit that I made that was after the https://twitter.com/goldenbustours. On that trip I visited the Rift Valley and I was much inspired by the beauty of that valley. Its geological features were awesome and have incredible sights. I have never visited the Amboseli National Park. It is looking nice. I hope that one day i will be there.

					Thank you Alliha. Amboseli is stunning - I was fortunate enough to visit the park this autumn. The large herds in the swamps with Mount Kili as the backdrop is hard to beat. Definitely worth a trip and easily accessible from Nairobi.&#160;
