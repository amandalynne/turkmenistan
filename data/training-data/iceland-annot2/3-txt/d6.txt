	10 Must-See Natural Attractions in Iceland


    ADVERTISEMENT


								Situated at the edge of the famous Arctic Circle and located in one of the most active volcano spots in the whole world, Iceland is increasing its popularity every day when it comes to tourism. Iceland, at present, has the prestige to be one of the most impressively beautiful places in all of Europe.


One can discover fantastic landscapes and natural spots such as the rugged fjords, hot springs, and mixture of glaciers. Tourism in this country is also becoming flourished by activities like taking a bath in superb blue lagoons and hiking in midnight sun.


Below are some of the most famous and visited natural attractions in this beautiful country.


1. Blue Lagoon
This popular man-made geothermal spa of crystal clear water is the only site on earth you can swim in 40 degree centigrade water year round, and yet be encircled by ice and snow. An area where a by-product of the Svartsengi geothermal power plant is located, the lagoon's rich mineral content is known to be helpful to a variety of settings. The icy aquamarine waters set alongside the black background of the plain landscape make this glaring contrast even more impressive making it the most photographed attraction in Iceland.

2. Great Geyser
This natural spot is situated in the south-western Iceland and has been active for over 10,000 years. It can spurt boiling water up to seventy meters in the air. Geysers are frequently caused by surface water, making its way down for about 2,000 meters. Upon reaching the boiling point, it will then spout very hot water with steam, and both natural occurrences are very impressive to watch in person.

3. Lake Myvatn
Established as a conservation area in 1974, this place has turn to be one of the best tourist attractions. There's much to discover here such as the waterfall of the Gods, which is considered the most famous waterfall in Europe. One can also see the lavishness of bird-life, volcanic craters as well as beautiful lakes.


4


4. Asbyrgi
This is a 3 1/2 kilometer long canyon with 100 meter walls. Fulmars may be seen in this place during the breeding season. Asbyrgi is situated in the northern most region of the famed Jokulsargliufur National Park.


5


5. Seljalandsfoss
Located between Sk√≥gafoss and Selfoss, the Seljalandsfoss is said to be one of the most photographed waterfalls in the country. Tourists can walk behind the 60-meter high waterfalls, making it a remarkable sight. The lush green setting and misty environs make this a perfect attraction to visit to take in the feel of the countryside.


6


6. Glymur
Iceland's highest waterfall is graceful and nimble. Streamlets go downhill like ribbons of a post into an unfathomable canyon mantled in lush mosses and bird nests. The trek in this area is somewhat deceitful, but those people who brave it are pleased with captivating scenery as well as total solitude.


7


7. Gullfoss
This astonishing waterfall climaxes and crowns the renowned "Golden Circle" the country's most common day trip from the capital. This place looks almost too flawlessly landscaped to be real, but is definitely is.


8


8. Raufarholshellir
With the accurate precautions and preparations, any tourist can just walk straight into this lava-tube cavern and saunter more than 3/4 mile or a kilometer to its dimmest depths, past peculiar ice candles and lava formations.


9


9. Latrabjarg
These massive sea cliffs at Iceland's western most point verify that the "endpoints of the earth" certainly come with a bang. The sheer volume of many types of birds is incredible, and the puffins (photographed) are willing to have their photo taken.


10


10. Hornbjarg
These ocean cliffs in this country's far northwest are not simple and easy to reach, but travelers are treated to the most stunning sight on the Iceland's entire coastline. A razor-backed and undulating ridge is carved against the sky and on its inland part, a sheer-hill scoops down to a lovely plateau. The opposite side is a pure 534 meters drop to the sea.
