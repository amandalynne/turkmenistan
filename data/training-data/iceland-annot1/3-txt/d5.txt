                                Home &#187; Worldwide destinations &#187; Europe &#187; Undiscovered Iceland: West Iceland     
                        
                
                When thinking of Iceland, most people picture the Blue Lagoon and the Golden Circle, but what if you avoided the typical Icelandic tourist traps and instead headed to the rugged West Country for adventures that mirror some of the great Icelandic legends.


We&#8217;ve been in touch with Gudmundur, Visit Iceland&#8217;s self-proclaimed human search engine who happily supplied us with some tips and insider knowledge on where to go if you head west. So why not avoid the crowds and discover some of Iceland&#8217;s best kept secrets.

See &amp; Do
Sn&#230;fellsnes Circle

Forget the Golden Circle, there&#8217;s way more to see on the Sn&#230;fellsnes Circle and it&#8217;s far less touristy. Located in the Sn&#230;fellsj&#246;kull National Park the route follows rugged coastline, passes incredible natural wonders such as lava fields, lakes, beaches and finishes at the Sn&#230;fellsj&#246;kull Glacier. The glacier is ancient and reported to have magical powers, it lies along the ridge of a mountain peak, running the length of the peninsula.


It is possible to see the entire circle in one day, but if you are not in a rush then spread it out over two or three days and make the most of the activities such as hiking and climbing along the way.


Hraunfossar Waterfalls

Stretching over 900 metres, the Hraunfossar waterfalls are a collection of cascades and streams, oozing out of the lava mountains. The water sometimes appears milky white whilst other times it emerges as bright turquoise. Just above Hraunfossar is Barnafoss waterfall another well-known waterfall known as the &#8216;Children&#8217;s Waterfall&#8217; after two children, according to folklore, fell into the water and drowned while crossing a natural stone bridge. Thereafter, the children&#8217;s mother cast a spell on the bridge saying that anyone who crossed it would also drown. Iceland is full of spooky folk tales and ancient traditions, another reason it is well worth a visit.


Kirkjufell Mountain

The most photographed mountain in Iceland and for good reason! Surrounded by scenic beaches, this mountain with its needle sharp point is like something out of Middle Earth. There are beautiful, scenic walking trails around the mountain, and if you are brave enough you can even hike up it, finding fish and bird fossils along the way &#8211; a guide is recommended to ensure you get the full experience.


Brei&#240;afj&#246;r&#240;ur

A shallow bay of about 50km and surrounded by mountains including the volcano Sn&#230;fellsj&#246;kull, &#160;Brei&#240;afj&#246;r&#240;ur offers sea views, diverse wildlife, flora and fauna and spectacular walking trails. Flatey Island lies off the bay and from May to September is home to one of Iceland&#8217;s breeding puffin colonies and is well worth a visit. As a must-see for nature lovers Brei&#240;afj&#246;r&#240;ur is also a great place to get views of the Sn&#230;fellsj&#246;kull Glacier or to charter a boat for a fishing trip.


Deildartunguhver hot spring

This hot spring is a feat of nature but be warned this is not Mother Nature at her most maternal. The hot springs are too hot to bathe in (100&#176;c) but the hot water is used by towns in its immediate radius, so even if you take a shower 65km away you&#8217;ve technically bathed in Deildartunguhver. Despite not being quite on the scale of the blue lagoon, it attracts far less crowds and is Europe&#8217;s most powerful hot spring.


Whale Watching

Off the shores of West Iceland the surrounding sea is home to around twenty whale species. If you&#8217;re lucky you can also encounter dolphins and combine the trip with some bird-watching including rare puffin colonies. The best time for whale watching is in the summer from May to September while bird-watching fans can enjoy the season from around June to September.


Eat &amp; Drink
The Old Fish Packing House

Built in 1918 as a packing house for local fish products, the building has now been renovated into a cosy caf&#233; and restaurant. This is a great spot for trying some tasty catch of the day (obviously), but also to mix with the locals. As well as offering traditional Icelandic cuisine, there&#8217;s also the option to enjoy some live music.


H&#250;safell Bistro


Perfect if you&#8217;re in the area visiting the Hraunfossar waterfalls, the H&#250;safell Bistro is an artistic and cosy bistro serving various different Icelandic delicacies, including traditional lamb soup and Arctic char. The restaurant is open every day during the season but double check the opening times before you go as it varies during the week. There is also the H&#250;safell Hotel nearby which features&#160;a restaurant serving gourmet Icelandic cuisine. 


Caf&#233; Kj&#243;s

With the exception of winter weekends, Caf&#233; Kj&#243;s is only open during summertime and offers refreshments and light meals with a beautiful view over Lake Medalfellsvatn. Just North of Reykavik it makes the perfect pit stop on your way to the Western tip of Iceland.
