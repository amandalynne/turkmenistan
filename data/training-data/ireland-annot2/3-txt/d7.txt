&#160;<em>Ireland is a continuous shade of green with weather more temperamental than one could imagine. But it is filled with some of the most magical scenery I have discovered in the world, the liveliest and chattiest people, and is the perfect destination for a 7 day road trip. </em>

		
1. Kylemore Abbey
The first of the 10 places you must visit in Ireland is Kylemore Abbey, founded in the Kylemore Castle for Nuns who fled Belgium in World War I. The castle was originally built as a private home by Mitchell Henry as a gift to his wife, whom later tragically died at a reasonably young age. Henry never remarried and built a small cathedral on the castle grounds in her loving memory. It&#8217;s as beautiful as the photo suggests and an absolute must visit for a road trip through Ireland.


&#160;


2. Connemara National Park
Located just next to Kylemore Abbey is the Connemara National Park. Not only is this area beautiful to drive around, but there are some great opportunities to hike and trek through the Connemara National Park. The area is quite remote on the absolute West Coast of Ireland, but that just makes it all the more special.


&#160;


3. Dublin
Ireland&#8217;s capital is alive with music, pubs, and a great street culture. A visit to Ireland just wouldn&#8217;t be complete without spending the weekend in the capital. Be sure to visit St Stephen&#8217;s Green, the Guinness Storehouse, and Grafton street for shopping and live buskers on the streets.


&#160;


4. Slieve League
Located along the coastline are Europe&#8217;s highest cliffs at Slieve League. Forget the commercialised Cliffs of Moher (although equally stunning), but it is at Slieve League where you can truly take in the natural beauty and feel as though you have it all to yourself.


&#160;


5. Gleniff Horseshoe
This 10km loop shaped in a horseshoe is as beautiful as the picture suggests. Located in county sligo, this is the perfect chance to get off the highway and enjoy the Irish countryside or take a hike along one of the tracks.


&#160;


6. Mullaghmore Beach
Also in Sligo is the quaint and charming seaside town of Mullaghmore. Many tourists pass by without knowing to stop and bypass this stunning seaside town &#8211; don&#8217;t be one of them!


&#160;


7. Ashford Castle (or any of the castle hotels)
Ashford Castle is the crowning glory of castle hotels &#8211; but there are also many other great castle hotels in Ireland that should receive equal praise.


&#160;


8. The Irish Countryside
Just. Get. Lost.

										[&#8230;] Ireland has been ranked the 11th most safe country in the world, so if safety is your concern there&#8217;s no issues here. It&#8217;s as cliche as you imagined &#8211; green, rains a lot, lots of open space. The perfect blend for an Irish road trip to wander at your own pace and experience some of the world&#8217;s most underrated scenery. Don&#8217;t know where to start? try 8 places you must visit in Ireland. [&#8230;]

										If you get a chance to ever return, do try to visit the south-west. The Ring of Kerry is absolutely amazing, not to mind Killarney (although I am quite biased). If you want to see breathtaking scenery climb Torc Mountain (or even just the waterfall) and the town itself; It is exquisite! Also Galway has an amazing culture, being incredibly diverse but keeping the old school Irish feel.

										I&#8217;m trying to arrange a volunteer job in Ireland for the summer. You pictures make me wish I was there right now! In your experience is the immigration at the border cool with spending the entire three months there? Did they ask what you are doing? Is it possible to do a border run to get an additional 3 months if I went to France and back for example? I called the Irish Embassy and they said I can volunteer with just my US passport but they said they won&#8217;t put it in writing. Um&#8230; ok. :/

										[&#8230;] The land of green pastures and torrential rain&#8230; Ireland really lives up to its&#8217; cliche in the best possible way. But what is still surprising to most who visit Ireland is the&#160;unparalleled natural beauty to be discovered here.

										Slieve League are not Europe&#8217;s highest cliffs. Nor are they Ireland&#8217;s highest!

Croaghaun on Achill Island are the highest sea cliffs in Ireland and they themselves are only the 3rd highest in Europe.
