There is a European Geoparks network - over 30 Geoparks all over Europe; there is also a growing worldwide network of Geoparks associated with UNESCO. Copper Coast is the only European Geopark wholly in the Republic. (There is one which straddles the border - Fermanagh/Cavan). There is an office in Bunmahon in a former Church of Ireland church which the Copper Coast Geopark group are gradually turning into a community, cultural and interpretive centre. Here you can get walking cards and help and guidance on what to do in the area. Copper Coast Geopark. 

The Copper Coast Geopark is an outdoor museum of geological records. Volcanoes, oceans, deserts and ice sheets all combined to create the rocks which provide the physical foundation of the natural and cultural landscapes of the area.

		Dunbrody Famine Ship
		

			The Dunbrody is an exact replica of the original ship built in 1845. This impressive barque carried thousands of Irish people from the desperation of the Great Famine in Ireland to America, the land that offered them hope of a better life.

Board the Dunbrody and walk in the footsteps of a group of Irish famine emigrants on their journey of hope across the Atlantic Ocean. Go below deck and enter the confined spaces, which would be home for passengers and crew for the forty five day voyage.

Descend in to the cargo hold, where the exhibition describes the endurance, struggle and triumph over adversity of those 19th Century emigrants as epitomised by the story of the most famous emigrant sons of New Ross, President John F. Kennedy.

		Dunmore Cave
		

			Dunmore Cave boasts some of the largest and most impressive calcite formations in Ireland. The largest of these is known as the Market Cross, a name which in recent years was adopted by a shopping centre in nearby Kilkenny. The cave was once home to a large bat colony, and there are still bats there in some of the darker and deeper parts of the cave, though considerably fewer than in the past. 

The cave is open year round, from 9.30am &#8211; 6.30pm every day from June to September, with earlier closing in other months.

The cave is reached via a long and pretty steep flight of steps, which is fine going down but quite a climb coming out, so a reasonable level of fitness is needed. There is no accessibility for wheelchairs or for children&#8217;s buggies. There is a small but informative visitor centre, and a tearoom which serves delicious cupcakes is open during the summer months.

		Edmund Rice International Heritage Centre
		

			Edmund Rice began his educational mission among the poor of Waterford. His work was strongly supported by the people of the city, though some of his friends thought he was mad to give up a successful business career. However, the people of Waterford always expressed their appreciation for his efforts. It is fitting then that the city should hold pride of place in honouring and telling the story of Edmund Rice whose spirit and mission has spread to all six continents.

Knowing the historical and cultural significance of the place, one cannot help but feel motivated and inspired. It's a refreshing change from other visitor centres and a great place for people of all ages to educate and enjoy themselves. After all, it's not easy to find a tourist attraction which appeals to everyone. That's what makes this place so special. Edmund Rice was a man of courage and commitment with a lasting legacy and global appeal. If you're looking for somewhere new, look no further.
