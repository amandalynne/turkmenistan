			Although narrowing Morocco's plethora of incredible destinations down to a top ten list is difficult, 160;no trip to the North African nation would be complete without a visit to at least one of 160;the four imperial cities. In particular, 160;Marrakech, Fes, and Meknes are packed full of colorful bazaars, breathtaking palaces and bustling town squares. Morocco is also famous for its natural beauty, from the golden beaches of seaside towns like 160;Essaouira 160;and Asilah, to the magnificent arid landscapes of the Sahara Desert. Here, the possibilities for adventure are endless. Try a camel-back 160;trek 160;through the Sahara, climb North Africa's highest peak, or head to Dades Valley for a few nights in a traditional kasbah. 160;

						Situated at the foot of the Atlas Mountains, the imperial city of Marrakech is noisy, atmospheric and full of history. There's a lot to see and do in Marrakech. Highlights include the central square of Djemma El-Fna; the Saadian Tombs, the Marjorelle Gardens and the bustling souqs or bazaars. For the most authentic Marrakech experience, consider staying within the medina walls in one of the city's traditional Riads. 160;

						Medieval Fes was Morocco's capital for more than 400 years and is still considered the religious and cultural center of the country. 160;The old walled part of the city, known as 160;Fes El Bali, is quite extraordinary and best 160;explored on foot. Other highlights include the Chaouwara Tanneries, the 160;Merenid Tombs, the Sultanate palace of Dar el-Makhzen 160;and the Mellah 160;or Jewish Quarter. 160;

						Essaouira is a great place to get away from the heat and bustle of the bigger cities. In the 1960s, the seaside town was a popular beach hangout for icons like Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley. Other than the beach, highlights include strolling through the town's narrow streets filled with red and blue painted houses, exploring the ramparts, and listening to traditional Gnawa music.

						Situated in the Rif Mountains, Chefchaouen is a small town in a big landscape. It's popular with independent travelers (perhaps because it is the cannabis capital of Morocco) and with those wanting to see the town's famous blue-and-white-painted houses. Highlights include hiking and wild 160;swimming in the surrounding countryside, and enjoying a drink amidst the architecture of Outa el Hammam square.

						Merzouga is small desert town on the edge of Erg Chebbi, a mesmerising sea of wind-blown Saharan sand dunes. 160;It is the gateway to the wilderness of the desert interior, and the perfect place to get a taste of Bedouin life. Camel treks are the easiest and most authentic way to explore the surrounding landscape, where knife-edged dunes and blazing blue skies create the classic Saharan backdrop. 160;

						Jebel Toubkal, situated in the High Atlas Mountains, is North Africa's highest peak at 160;13,667 feet/ 4,167 meters. It's a challenging trek to the snow-dusted summit, but 160;the spectacular views are well worth the effort. While you can make it to the summit and back to the town of Imlil in a day, it's recommended you take at least three days in order to acclimatise to the high altitude and make the most of the scenery. 160;

						Meknes is smaller and more laid back than Marrakech and Fes yet it has all the charms you'd expect of an imperial city - 160;including a well-preserved medina filled with easily navigable souqs. Meknes was the capital during the rule of 17th Century Sultan 160;Moulay Isma 239;l, and is a showcase of Moroccan architecture complete with huge gates and impressive carvings. The nearby Roman ruins of Volubilis are also well worth a trip.

						The Dades Valley runs between the Jebel Sarhro and High Atlas mountain ranges and offers some of Morocco's most spectacular scenery. The deep red cliffs on each side are lined with traditional forts known as kasbahs, many of which have been turned into luxury hotels. The best way to appreciate the valley and its Berber villages is on foot, especially when you reach the Todra and Dades Gorges. 160;

						Tangier is the gateway to Africa for many travelers. While the city doesn't have quite the charm it did in the 1940s and 1950s when you could rub shoulders with the likes of Truman Capote, Paul Bowles and Tennessee Williams there's still a lot to see. Highlights include the medina, the Kasbah Museum, and the Ville Nouvelle. The harbour also offers interesting views of the Strait of Gibraltar and distant Spain.

						Situated on Morocco's North Atlantic coast, seaside 160;Asilah is very popular with Moroccan vacationers who flock to its sandy beaches during 160;the hot summer months. The city walls are covered in colorful murals and the houses are painted white, evoking the white-washed towns of the 160;Greek Islands. Every August, artists, musicians and street performers flock to Asilah for the town's vibrant annual Arts Festival. 160;
