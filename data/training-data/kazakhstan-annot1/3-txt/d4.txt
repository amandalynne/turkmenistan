							By Dmitry Lee
									
				
					Whether you like hiking, swimming, fishing or horseback riding, are just interested in Kazakhstan or have visited the country at least once in your life, you no doubt know the nation has a number of unique summer vacation destinations. EdgeKz has compiled a list of the most exciting locations to visit from May-September.


Burabai

Burabai is often referred to as a &#8220;little Switzerland&#8221; in the Kazakh steppe. Its advantageous location from Astana, just a comfortable three-hour drive along one of the country&#8217;s widest high-end speedways, makes it the top vacation spot for city residents who flock there almost every weekend for a swim. Russian tourists in particular visit to enjoy Burabai&#8217;s hiking trails.

Bukhtarma Reservoir

Bukhtarma Reservoir in the East Kazakhstan region is formed by a dam on the Irtysh River. One of the largest artificial reservoirs in the world with an area of 5,500 square kilometers, Bukhtarma is 120 kilometers from Oskemen. The waterway attracts thousands of Kazakh and Russian tourists each year and the best time to visit is July-August when the water reaches the highest temperatures.

Kapshagai Reservoir

Lake Alakol

The best time to travel to this remote destination is mid-June to mid-August. Its two famous big beaches, Koktuma and Akshy, are located on the southwest shore and serve as great summer getaways.

The Charyn Canyon

The Charyn Canyon is about 200 kilometers southeast of Almaty and stretches for nearly 154 kilometers. Hiking in the canyon is recommended with a local guide who can be hired in Almaty prior to the trip, as it is easy to get lost in the many small valleys.

For those who want to travel in luxury, helicopters can also be taken to the canyon.
