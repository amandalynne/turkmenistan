Kenya Tourist Attractions and Sightseeing

(Kenya, KE, East Africa)


Many of Kenya's main tourist attractions can be found in the great outdoors, such as its enticing beaches, although the real stars of the show are most likely to be animals. Indeed, Kenya is one of the best places in Africa to see wildlife in abundance.


Tourists will find that leading attractions often combine wildlife with displays of traditional culture, giving visitors a chance to find out more about what makes Kenya tick. In Nairobi, attractions are at their most plentiful and come in the form of the famous Giraffe Manor, the Nairobi Arboretum, Snake Park, Uhuru Park and the Mamba Village, amongst others.

Beaches
Address: State House Road, Nairobi, Kenya, KE, Africa

The sumptuous sandy beaches of Kenya have long been a major draw card for tourists and line the beautiful coastline of the Indian Ocean. Many extremely popular beach resorts are based around Mombasa, with Diani Beach being amongst the city's best and known for both its water sports and its friendly primates, which include Colobus and Vervet monkeys. Nearby, you may like to spend time sunbathing on the beaches around Kilifi, Shelly and Tiwi. Further afield, Malindi and Watamu also rank as notable beach resorts, while the sandy stretches of Lamu Island and Kiwayu Island regularly attract day trippers. Beachgoers should note that beachwear is not considered to be appropriate attire for strolling around towns.
