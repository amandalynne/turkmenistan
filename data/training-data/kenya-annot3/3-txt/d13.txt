The vast wildlife found in Kenya can be found throughout the country&#8217;s wildlife parks and reserves.&#160; Many times you are able to see exotic animals like lions, cheetahs, monkeys, and many others in their natural habitat.&#160; There are even many homes in&#160;Kenya&#160;that have wild monkeys living in front and back yards.&#160; As with many places in Africa, many times you are able to play with some of the exotic animals at places like the animal orphanage (I would recommend the babies not the adults).
