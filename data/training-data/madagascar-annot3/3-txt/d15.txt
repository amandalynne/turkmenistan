Top 5 : Family friendly travel activities in Madagascar
Although Madagascar is still a bit off the travel map for most tour agencies and tourists, it doesn't mean that going to this amazing country has to be an adventure.


Here are 5 family friendly ( and kid friendly)  activities you can do while in Madagascar.

1. Explore the National Parks

In every National Park, tracks and itineraries of different length and difficulties exist. The easies hikes (2 to 3 hours in total) are done in some trails which are well maintained conditions (with stairs, bridges over rivers, etc..) . 
Local guides are very knowledgeable and always happy to adjust hikes to your physical fitness. Some the easiest parks to explore are: Andasibe , Ranomafana, Isalo, Montagne d'Ambre.




2. Get up close with animals

Kids love this! We are lucky enough that we don't count many dangerous animals on the island.  Being able to approach lemurs , snakes, chameleons without being in danger is an amazing experience and will give you some priceless pictures to take home as souvenirs. This can be done in many places such as Andasibe, Nosy Komba.




3. Cultural & Historical Day Tour of Antananarivo

The island is known for its amazing biodiversity and unique landscapes but we do not talk much about the unicity of its culture.  An unique crossroad between Africa and Asia, the history of Madagascar is very rich and each region has its own traditions. You can start your exploration in the vibrant capital of Antananarivo, its market and learn about the history of the country the royal residences ( palace and summer citadel ). Did you know that the British were the first to recognize the kingdom of Madagascar?
Walking downtown during day time in the colourful city is still very safe as long as your take usual precautions ( leave your gold necklace at home ).

4. Beach stay & Snorkelling

With 5000km of coast, it's easy to find a beach with unspoilt white sand and turquoise sea. The waters surrounding Madagascar are also hosting some of the most beautiful corral reefs, giving you great opportunities to snorkel and spot some colourful fishes, sea turtles. Nosy Tanikely and the Emerald Sea offer some of the best experiences as snorkelling tours include a meal cooked right on the beach by the local fishermen.




5. Cooking classes

Ever fancying to cook an exotic meal at home? This can be a very fun activity to engage kids to eat healthy meals. Malagasy dishes are influenced by East african , Asian and French gastronomy. Although it sounds complicated , it is not as the preparation of delightful dishes do not comprise many ingredients nor steps.
