<font size="2" color="#000000">Ethiopia&#146;s uniqueness makes it a
fascinating destination for every kind of travel le r, but in particular for the traveller
who wants that bit more. Ethiopia&#146;s historic sites are extremely wide-ranging and
possibly the most extensive in the whole of Sub-Saharan Africa. Experts claim that such
sites are only a fraction of what Ethiopia has to offer given that a further 95% remain to
be discovered and excavated. </font>

			<font size="5">
			1. The Simien Mountain National Park (North 
			Gondar Zone)  </font>

					<font size="2"></font> 
				
					
					<font size="2">Mountains of Ethiopia</font> 
				
				
		<font size="2" color="#000000">The Simien mountain is
    one of the major highlands of Africa, rising to the highest point in Ethiopia, Ras Dejen
    (4620m), which is the fourth highest peak in the continent. Although Simien is in Africa
    and not too far from the equator, snow and ice appear on the highest points and night
    temperatures often fall below zero.</font> 
				&#160;
	
		<font size="2" color="#000000">The
    national park has three general botanical regions. The higher lands are mountain
    grasslands with fescue grasses as well as heathers, splendid Red Hot Pokers and Giant Lobelia. The park was created primarily to protect the Walia Ibex, and over 1000 are said
    to live in the park. Also in the park are families of the unique Gelada Baboon with its
    scarlet &#145;bleeding heart on its chest,&#146; and the rare Simien fox. The Simien fox,
    although named after the mountains is rarely seen by the visitor. Over 50 species of birds
    have been reported in the Simien mountains.</font> 
				&#160;
				
	
	<font size="2" color="#000000">Access to the park is from Debark, 101km
from Gonder, where riding and pack animals may be hired. This should be arranged in
advance through your local tour operator or the Office of the Wildlife Conservation
Department.</font>

		&#160;
		
		
					<font size="2">Lalibela, 
					642 kilometres from Addis Ababa, is internationally-renowned for its rock-hewn churches which are sometimes called the 
					"Eighth Wonder of the World". Physically prised from the 
					rock in which they stand, these monolithic churches were 
					originally thought to have been built in the 12th century 
					during the reign of King Lalibela, but some have been dated 
					back to the 10th century. There are eleven churches, 
					assembled in three groupings: </font> 
				
&#160;
				
					
									<font size="2">The 
									Northern Group: Bete Medhane Alem, home to 
									the Lalibela Cross and believed to be the largest monolithic church in the world.  
									It is linked to Bete Maryam (possibly the 
									oldest of the churches), Bete Golgotha 
									(known for its arts and said to contain the 
									tomb of King Lalibela), the Selassie Chapel 
									and the Tomb of Adam.</font> 
								
&#160;
								
									
									<font size="2">The Western 
									Group: Bete Giyorgis, said to be the most finely executed and best preserved church.</font> 
								
&#160;

					<font>
					
				 </font>
				
					
					<font size="2">Gondar is famous 
		for its many medieval castles and the design and decoration of its 
		churches. The earliest of the castles was created by Fasilidas himself 
		and is still in such an excellent state of repair that it is possible to 
		climb its stats all the way to the roof, which commands a breathtaking view over much of the city.</font>

						&#160;
					
				
				<font size="2">
				748 kilometres 
		from Addis Ababa is the graceful city of Gondar, founded by Emperor 
		Fasilidas in 1635. The city was Ethiopia's capital until the reign of the would-be reforming Emperor Tewodros II, also known as Theodore. 
		During its long years as a capital city, the settlement emerged as one 
		of the largest and most popular cities in the realm. It was a great 
		centre of commerce, trading with the rich lands south of the Blue Nile, 
		as well as with Sudan to the west, and the Red Sea port of Massawa to 
		the north-east. </font>

    <font size="1">Aloes in the mountains of Ethiopia</font>


	<font size="2" color="#000000">The natural beauty of
    Ethiopia amazes the first-time visitor. Ethiopia is a land of rugged mountains (some are
    over 4000 meters high) broad savannah, lakes and rivers. The unique Rift Valley is a
    remarkable region of volcanic lakes, with their famous collections of birdlife, great
    escarpments and stunning vistas. Tisisat, the Blue Nile falls, must rank as one of the
    greatest natural spectacles in Africa today. With 14 major wildlife reserves, Ethiopia
    provides a microcosm of the entire subsaharan eco-system. Birdlife abounds and indigenous
    animals from the rare Walis Ibex to the shy wild ass roam free just as nature intended.
    Ethiopia, after the rains, is a land decked with flowers and with many more native plants
    than most countries in Africa. Among the many natural tourist attractions, only the
    principal ones are briefly given below.</font>


<font>&#160;</font>


<font size="2" color="#000000">The Blue Nile Falls (Tisisat Falls)</font>


    <font>

    </font>
    <font size="1" color="#000000">Blue Nile Falls</font>


	<font size="2" color="#000000">The River Nile, the longest
    river in Africa, in Ethiopia. From Lake Tana, the Blue Nile, known locally as Abbay, flows
    from Ethiopia to meet the white Nile in Khartoum to form the great river that gives life
    to Egypt and the Sudan. It has been said that the Blue Nile contributes up to 80% of the
    Nile&#146;s flow. Nowhere is it more spectacular than when it thunders over the Tisisat
    Falls near Bahar Dar. Here millions of gallons of water cascade over the cliff face and
    into a gorge, creating spectacular rainbows, in one of the most awe-inspiring displays in
    Africa, earning its name &#145;Smoking Water&#146;. The Blue Nile falls can easily be
    reached from Bahar Dar and the Scenic beauty of the Blue Nile Gorge, 225KM from Addis
    Ababa, can be enjoyed as part of an excursion from the capital.</font>


<font>&#160;</font>


<font size="2" color="#000000">Lake Tana</font>


<font size="2" color="#000000">Lake Tana, the largest lake in Ethiopia is
the source of the Blue Nile from where it starts its long journey to Khartoum and on to
the Mediterranean. The 37 islands that are scattered about the surface of the Lake shelter
fascinating churches and monastries, some of which have histories dating back to the 13<sup>th</sup>
Century. However, it should be noted that most of the religious houses are not open to
women. The most interesting islands are: Birgida Mariam, Dega Estefanous, Dek, Narga, Tana
Cherkos, Mitsele Fasiledes, Kebran and Debre Maryam. Kebran Gabriel is the principal
monastery which can be visited by male tourists from Bahar Dar with its impressive
Cathedral-like Building first built at the end of the 17<sup>th</sup> Century. Dega
Estephanos, which is also closed to women, is on an island in the lake, and is reached by
a very steep and winding path. Although the church is relatively new (only one hundred
years old), it houses a Madonna painted in the 15<sup>th</sup> century. However, the
treasury of the monastery is a prime attraction with the remains of several emperors, as
well as their robes and jewels.</font>


<font size="2" color="#000000">On the banks of the lake are many more
religious houses such as Ura Kidane Mehret and Narga Selassie, many of which are open to
women. </font>


<font size="2" color="#000000">Near Gorgora, at the northern end of the
lake, the Susneyos palace is a forerunner of the magnificent palaces and castles of
Gonder, and dates from the reign of Emperor Susneyos. In the same area the medieval church
of Debre Sina Mariam is particularly important.</font>


<font size="2" color="#000000">A sail or cruise on Lake Tana is one of the
most pleasant excursions for visitors to this region, particularly in the heart of the
summer. Boats can be hired from the Marine Transport Authority in Bahir Dar. Along the
lakeshore bird life, both local and migratory visitors, make this an ideal place for
birdwatchers. Bird lovers will not want to miss Fasilidas island, which is especially
famous as an important wetland. The whole of the lake Tana region and the Blue Nile Gorge
have a wide variety of birds both endemic and visitors. The variety of habitats, from
rocky crags to rain forests and important wetlands, ensure that many other different
species should be spotted.</font>


<font size="2">&#160;</font>


<font size="2" color="#000000">The Sof Omar Cave</font>


    <font size="2">

    </font>
    <font size="2" color="#000000">Sof Omar Cave</font>


	<font size="2" color="#000000">Sof Omar is one of the most
    spectacular and extensive underground cave systems in the world. Formed by the Wabi River
    as it changed its course in the distant past and carved out a new channel through
    limestone foothills, the Sof Omar systems is an extraordinary natural phenomenon of
    breathtaking beauty. </font>


	<font size="2" color="#000000">The cave which
    is now an important Islamic Shrine was named after the saintly Sheikh Sof Omar who took
    refuge here many centuries ago. The cave has a religious history that predates the arrival
    of the Muslims in Bale &#150; a history calculated in thousands of years.</font>


<font>&#160;</font>


<font size="2" color="#000000">The Rift Valley</font>


<font size="2" color="#000000">The Ethiopian Rift Valley, which is part of
the famous East African Rift Valley, comprises numerous hot springs, beautiful lakes and a
variety of wildlife. The valley is the result of two parallel faults in the earth&#146;s
surface, between which in distant geological time, the crust was weakened and the land
subsided. Ethiopia is often referred to as the &#145;water tower&#146; of Eastern Africa
because of the many rivers that pour off the high tableland. The Great Rift Valley&#146;s
passage through Ethiopia is marked by a chain of seven lakes. Each of the seven lakes has
its own special life and character and provides ideal habitats for the exuberant variety
of flora and fauna that make the region a beautiful and exotic destination for tourists.</font>


<font size="2" color="#000000">Most of the lakes are suitable and safe for
swimming and other water sports. Lakes Abiata and Shalla are ideal places for bird
watchers. Most of the Rift Valley lakes are not fully exploited for tourists except lake
Langano where tourist class hotels are built. The Rift Valley is also a site of numerous
natural hot springs and the chemical contents of the hot springs are highly valued for
their therapeutic purposes though at present they are not fully utilised. In short, the
Rift Valley is endowed with many beautiful lakes, numerous hot springs, warm and pleasant
climate and a variety of wildlife. It is considered as one of the most ideal areas for the
development of international tourism in Ethiopia.</font>

<font color="#008000" size="2">NATIONAL PARKS</font>


<font size="2" color="#000000">The Awash National Park</font>


<font size="2" color="#000000">Lying in the lowlands at the east of Addis
Ababa and striding the Awash River, the Awash National Park is one of the finest reserves
in Ethiopia. The Awash river, one of the major rivers of the horn of Africa, waters
important agricultural lands in the north of Ethiopia and eventually flows into the
wilderness of the Danakil Depression. The dramatic Awash Falls, as the river tumbles into
its gorge, is the sight not to be missed in the national park. Awash national park,
surrounding the dormant volcano of Fantale, is a reserve of arid and semi-arid woodland
and savannah, with riverain forests along the Awash river. Forty six species of animals
have been identified here, including beisa oryx and Swayne&#146;s heartbeest. The bird
life is prolific especially along the river and in the nearby lake Basaka and there are
fine endemic amongst the 392 species recorded. A special attraction is the beautiful clear
pools of the Filwoha hot springs.</font>


<font size="2" color="#000000">Access to the park is best from the main
Addis Assab highway, and there is a caravan lodge called Kereyu Lodge at the edged of the
gorge.</font>


&#160;


<font size="2" color="#000000">The Omo National Park</font>


    <font>

    </font>
    <font size="1">Leopard</font>


	<font size="2" color="#000000">One of the most beautiful
    national parks in Ethiopia, its 4068 km of wilderness bordered by the Omo river, is home
    to an amazing range of wildlife. 306 species of birds have been identified here, while
    large herds of eland, some buffalo, elephants, giraffe, cheetah, lion, leopard,
    Burchell&#146;s zebra are not uncommon.</font>


    <font size="1">

</font>
	<font>

    </font>
    <font size="1">Rafting on the River Omo</font>
    
	<font size="2" color="#000000">The park is not easily
    accessible, as the current means of access is via Omorate and the ferry to the north bank
    of the river. The park HQ is 75 km from Kibish settlement. However, a new airstrip is
    available close to the HQ and a pleasant campsite on the Mui River &#150; plans are in
    hand for further major improvements.</font>


&#160;


<font size="2" color="#000000">The Mago National Park</font>


    <font>

    </font>
    <font size="1">The Greater Kudu</font>


	<font size="2" color="#000000">Covering an area of 2162 km
    on the banks of the Omo River, the Mago National Park is relatively undeveloped for
    tourists. The broad grasslands teem with herds of buffalo, giraffe, elephants and kudu,
    while sometimes it is possible to find lions, leopards and Burchell&#146;s zebra. The
    abundant bird life here is typical of dry grasslands and river banks.</font>


&#160;


<font size="2" color="#000000">Gambala National Park </font>


    <font>

    </font>
    <font size="1">The Sacred Ibis</font>


	<font size="2" color="#000000">In these areas many
    interesting species of animals and birds can often be seen by the visitor. According to
    the wild life information office, Dowsett Forbs has identified 813 species of birds, 596
    residents and 224 regular seasonal migrants in Ethiopia.</font>
