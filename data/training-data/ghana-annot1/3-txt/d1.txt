Ghana Tourist Attractions and Sightseeing

(Ghana, GH, Western Africa)


Many of Ghana's main tourist attractions can be found in and around the capital city of Accra, including both Bojo Beach and Labadi Beach, as well as the bustling Makola Market. To make sure that you don't miss out on any, a tour taking in the main places of interest is a good alternative to making your own way around the city.


A number of tourist attractions can also be found further afield and spread all over Ghana, and really are worth the effort of getting there. Many visitors choose to base themselves in a large town or city, such as Kumasi, enjoying subsequent sightseeing day trips.

Bojo Beach
Address: Accra, Ghana, GH, Africa

Also located within the Accra area, the Bojo Beach resort is another leading family attraction and is a wonderful place to come and relax, alongside the Atlantic Ocean. A large car park is conveniently located close by, along with a traditional thatched restaurant, offering al fresco dining at possibly its very best. The white sandy beachfront itself can be reached by taking a small canoe or boat ride across a neighbouring river, for just a nominal charge. If you are looking for a little excitement here, then consider hiring a jet ski.

Open hours: daily

Admission: free


Labadi Beach
Address: Accra, Ghana, GH, Africa

Labadi Beach is situated just a short distance away from the city of Accra. It is undoubtedly very popular with both locals and tourists, making it a very busy place at the weekends. Nevertheless, an afternoon of sunbathing on the beach after a busy few days of sightseeing is an attractive proposition for many visitors.

Open hours: daily

Admission: free


Makola Market
Address: Accra, Ghana, GH, Africa

Accra's Makola Market may be a crowded, dusty, maze of umbrella-covered stalls, but it is something that every visitor to Ghana should experience at least once. Unusually for a market in a busy capital city, Makola doesn't offer much in the way of souvenir handcarvings or jewellery. Instead, it favours basic items needed for daily life in the city, including household wares, clothing and groceries. Most of the stalls are run by local women traders.

Open hours: daily

Admission: free


Boabeng Fiema Monkey Sanctuary
Address: Boabeng, Ghana, GH, Africa

Tel: +00 233 21 235465

The Monkey Sanctuary is a popular stopover for visitors to the nearby Mole National Park. This attraction is home to around 200 black-and-white Colobus monkeys, which can be regularly seen hanging from the trees, and some 500 Mona monkeys, who prefer to head to nearby villages in search of food. Villagers believe that these monkeys are sacred and they are therefore closely protected. There is even a monkey cemetery. Visitors are advised to visit the Boabeng Fiema Monkey Sanctuary either early in the morning or in the evening, as this is when the monkeys are at their most active and entertaining.

Open hours: daily

Admission: charge


Pikworo Slave Camp
Address: Nania Paga, Bolgatanga, Ghana, GH, Africa

At the beginning of the 19th century, the Pikworo Slave Camp was where most slaves who were captured in the north of Ghana were held before being transported to the slave market in Salaga. Evidence of daily life can still be seen in the form of holes, once used as cooking stoves.

Open hours: daily

Admission: charge


Paga Crocodile Pond
Address: Paga, Bolgatanga, Ghana, GH, Africa

If the thought of seeing some of the largest crocodiles in the world doesn't scare you, then a trip to Ghana's Paga Crocodile Pond is a must. The oldest reptile resident of the pond is thought to be over 85 years old. These Paga crocodiles are remarkably comfortable in human company, unlike their wild counterparts, allowing visitors to see and touch them at extremely close quarters.

Open hours: daily

Admission: charge


Aburi Botanical Gardens
Address: Aburi, Eastern Region, Ghana, GH, Africa

The Aburi Botanical Gardens were set up at the end of the 19th century. Today, that historical legacy is there for all to see, with a good selection of exotic plants, seasonal flowers and trees on view. Located just over 30 km / 19 miles to the north of Accra, the Aburi Botanical Gardens cover approximately 65 hectares / 160 acres and enjoy excellent views across the Accra coastal plain. Native butterflies and colourful African birds are to be found all around these charming gardens.

Open hours: Monday to Saturday - 08:30 to 17:00

Admission: charge
