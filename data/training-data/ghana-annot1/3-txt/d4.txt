BONWIRE, Ashanti region


&#160;&#160;


This place is about 18km North-East of Kumasi in the Ashanti region of Ghana and is famous for the production (weaving) of Kente. It is popularly said to be the best known of all African textiles. Kente originates from the word kenten, which means &#8220;basket.&#8221; The people of the Ashanti Kingdom call it Nwentoma or &#8220;woven cloth&#8221;. It is a very prestigious royal cloth worn only on extremely important occasions. Kente used to be a cloth for only kings. However, its use has become more widespread yet it still held in very high esteem by Akans and all Ghanaians. In Ghana, woven kente is made by the Akan people which includes the Asante, Fante and Nzema. The unique Asante kente is identified by its beautiful, multicolored patterns of bright colors and exquisite shapes

Paga is a sacred crocodile sanctuary located in the north-eastern part of Ghana. Crocodiles are considered as wild animals however the crocodiles found in Paga are very friendly and have a peaceful coexistence with humans. This unusual friendly relationship between the crocodiles and humans is overwhelming and many visitors find it difficult to comprehend. It is a great offence to kill or harm the crocodiles at Paga. Other tourist attractions in this area include the Paga-Nania slave camp, the mystery dam of Kayoro called Kukula and the Nasaga Game Reserve. These attractions are just a few kilometers away from Burkina-Faso.

In 1928, the Takoradi Port was established and it was the first port to be built in Ghana and till date, it handles both imports and exports.

With such a history, it is undoubtedly &#160;a great place to visit.


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;4. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;LIGHTHOUSE, Jamestown- Accra


The Lighthouse in Jamestown is surrounded by a village-like settlement almost entirely inhabited by fisher-folk. This colonial-era lighthouse was built in the 1930&#8217;s. It has no gift shops or extraordinarily amazing historic items and antiques but the panoramic view from the top is simply breath-taking. A couple of wooden boats and canoes carefully arranged at the shores gives a deep insight into the predominant occupation of the community. It is also very close to tourist attractions such as the Ga-Mantse Palace, the James Fort, the Kwame Nkrumah Mausoleum and the Accra Sports Stadium.

Probably Ghana&#8217;s only and most effective Ostrich Farm. It is located at Efutu Mampong about 14km from Cape Coast. The ostriches found there are some of the world&#8217;s largest living birds and are distinct for their very long necks and heavy eggs. Ostriches can averagely live up to between 30-70 years. A visit to the farm is generally very interesting and adventurous because one can walk right up to them, touch them, feed them leaves, and hold an ostrich egg.
