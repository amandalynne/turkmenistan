                        Argentina is the eighth biggest country in the world, and in terms of landscapes, it is one of the most diverse places imaginable, offering vibrant jungle, wild-life packed wetlands, dramatic glaciers, mammoth mountains, sprawling pampas, dune-dotted beaches and shockingly turquoise lakes. Here, we've chosen the most inspiring destinations across Argentina, including the Vineyards in Mendoza, the towering waterfalls of Iguaz&#250; and the awe inspiring glaciers around El Calafate, and singled out the most appealing hotels and restaurants in each.                    


                                CityBuenos AiresA European-style metropolis where  anything goesWhere else can you get your tango fix at practically  any hour? (Dance it, or watch it &#8211; take your pick.) Here, there&#8217;s  enough beef to make the most ardent carnivore reach for a salad. Cups  overflow with wine that&#8217;s as piquant and full-bodied as it is  inexpensive. And Boca Juniors and River Plate matches satisfy the  football-obsessed. But even for teetotalling vegetarians with two left  feet and no interest in spectator sports, the Argentinian capital is  brimming with potential.

While BA may lack the iconic landmarks  of Paris, London or Rome, its visual delights are numerous. Being in the  city is like visiting the world&#8217;s largest film set, filled with  intriguing details (both period and contemporary), unforgettable scenery  and a fascinating cast.

HotelsThe Cocker
Set in a grand and  beautiful old house, Cocker been blazing a trail as one of the most original  and finest boutique establishments in San Temlo since it opened in 2006. The restored  interior comes complete with a grand piano and a series of leafy roof  gardens and terraces. The name, in case you were  wondering, was inspired by the former owners&#8217; cocker spaniel.

<em>San  Telmo Avenida Juan de Garay 458, between Defensa &amp; Bol&#237;var (011   4362 8451, www.thecocker.com). &#163;&#163;.</em>

RestaurantsLas Cabras
This insanely popular parrilla has proven to be a great  success on the overcrowded Palermo eating scene. The secret recipe? It&#8217;s  simple: cheap, good-quality food. Reservations are not permitted, so get there early or very  late, or expect to join the throngs queuing on the pavement.

<em>Palermo Viejo Fitz Roy 1795, at El  Salvador (011 5197 5301). &#163;&#163;.</em>

Getting thereAll international  flights arrive at and depart from Ezeiza (Aeropuerto Ministro Pistarini,  011 5480 6111, www.aa2000.com.ar), which is approximately 45 minutes by  taxi from the city centre. Aeroparque Internacional Jorge Newberry (011 5480 3000,   www.aa2000.com.ar) is Buenos Aires&#8217; downtown airport, serving domestic   destinations and Uruguay.

When to goSpring and autumn &#8211;  October to December and April to June, respectively  &#8211; are ideal times  to visit Buenos Aires. However, at any time of year,  be prepared for rain; heavy storms or a day or so  of solid downpour.

RosarioAn  up-and-coming city on the banks of the  R&#237;o Paran&#225;To define  Rosario as a mini Buenos Aires is to overlook  its biggest asset. Unlike  the capital, which shuns its waterways and  faces squarely inland,  Rosario embraces its riverside location.  Alongside the tea-coloured R&#237;o  Paran&#225;, you&#8217;ll find riverfront bars and  boardwalks, residents lining  up their kayaks and boats, and restaurants  in which fish are a menu  centrepiece, not just a hasty afterthought once  all parts of a cow have  been exhausted.

Rosario's much-lauded  claims to fame include  the city being the birthplace of both Che Guevara  and the nation&#8217;s  flag. The city also prides  itself on  having a thriving arts scene, a lively nightlife and,  allegedly, the  country&#8217;s most beautiful women.

HotelsLungomare  Trieste 
Run by the  eager-to-help Oliver, with his mother Monica and  sister Alejandra, this  cheerful townhouse is Rosario&#8217;s best  home-from-home experience.  Lungomare Trieste was the name of the street  where Monica&#8217;s mother  lived in southern Italy, and the European heritage  doesn&#8217;t stop there:  the house itself is Catalan in style, with original  tiles to prove it.  The five bedrooms are painted in vibrant colours and  come with private  bathrooms. Upstairs is a small roof terrace with a  pileta (plunge  pool).

<em>Pichincha  Tucum&#225;n 2687 (0341 439 8887, www.lungomarebb.com).  &#163;.</em>

RestaurantsLa Estancia
Rosario&#8217;s most famous parrilla has been turning  over  steaks on Avenida Pellegrini for more than 25 years. Some  Rosarinos  will tell you this is more the real deal than its touristy  porte&#241;o  counterparts, even if  does attract the occasional celebrity, such as locally born  football  hero Lionel Messi. The huge, pack-&#8217;em-in dining room is a great place to sit among crowds of   locals to share in the reverence for all things <em>carne</em>.

<em>Centro Pellegrini 1501 (0341 440   7373, www.parrillalaestancia.com.ar). &#163;&#163;&#163;.</em>

Getting   thereRosario is located 300 kilometres north-west of Buenos   Aires. The trip between the cities takes four hours 30 minutes by bus (www.terminalrosario.com.ar) or six hours 30    minutes by train (Trenes de Buenos Aires, 0800 3333 822, www.tbanet.com.ar;    Ferrocentral, 0800 1221 8736, www.ferrocentralsa.com.ar).

The airport, which is served by Aerol&#237;neas   Argentinas (www.aerolineas.com.ar), is 13 kilometres from the centre.

When to goRosario is generally hot between November and March, and cold between  June  and August. Be sure to visit at the weekend if you want to party,  and in  low season if you want some space on Florida beach.

CoastPinamar, Caril&#243;  &amp; Mar de las PampasUpmarket  beach towns, set amid a pine  forestA four-hour hop from the  capital, the towns of Pinamar and  Caril&#243;, with Valeria del Mar  sandwiched between them, and Mar de las  Pampas 25 kilometres south, are  a summertime playground of the smart  set, including Argentinian  A-listers and former presidents. Cranking up  in December, the area  awakens from its winter slumbers and the dunes and  forest spring back  to life. Unlike the crowded resort of Mar del Plata,  where you&#8217;ll fight  for a patch of sand at the height of summer, the  Costa Verde (or Green  Coast, as the area is sometimes known) is a much  classier affair, with  beaches extending to 300 metres wide in places,  providing ample space  to stretch out.

But deciding to visit the  Costa Verde isn&#8217;t  quite as easy as it sounds. One enduring conundrum  remains:&#8200;should you  take advantage of 15 hours of daily summer sun from  January to March,  or enjoy blustery winter walks on deserted beaches  followed by tea next  to a roaring log fire? That choice is yours.

HotelsTerrazas al Mar 
Terrazas al Mar has the coast on its doorstep, indoor   and outdoor pools, and is situated just a few metres away from buzzing   Avenida Bunge. It also has an excellent modern European restaurant and   countless spa and beauty treatments. Many rooms have scene-stealing sea views; suites hot tubs too.
<em>
Pinamar Avenida del Mar &amp;  De  las Gaviotas (02254 480900,  www.terrazasalmar.com). &#163;&#163;&#163;.</em>

RestaurantsEl Dorado
A five-star beach club with a fine sea view,  El  Dorado is known for its attention to detail and extremely high level  of  service, with career waiters attending to your every whim. Sample   home-made pasta, fresh seafood, fish and red meats in its elegant,   modern interior. A comprehensive wine list, headed by El Esteco bodega,   rounds off an excellent gastronomic experience.

<em>Pinamar Avenida del Mar, between  Bunge  &amp; De las Gaviotas (02254   400387, www.eldoradopinamar.com.ar). &#163;&#163;&#163;.</em>

Getting thereCoach companies El R&#225;pido (011 4314  8799), Plaza (011 4312  9328) and Plusmar (011 4315 3424) run several  daily services from Retiro  bus station to Pinamar, which take around  four hours 30 minutes. For Mar de las Pampas,  it&#8217;s a five-hour trip by coach  to Villa Gesell and a taxi ride from  there. You can also fly: Aer&#243;dromo  Villa Gesell (02255 457301, 02255  454657) is around 14 kilometres from  Pinamar. Flights from Aeroparque  Jorge Newbery in Buenos Aires are more  frequent during the summer.

When  to goTemperatures  reach 30&#176;C during the summer months of  January and February, when  water-sport activities, fishing trips and  fashion shows are at their  height. By March, activities start to taper off, and  in April you can  claim the beach as your own. Winter (July to  September) is all about  bracing, blustery beach walks.

Salta  &amp; JujuySpectacular  valleys, colonial towns and Andean  cultureSalta and Jujuy  blow every pampas/glass-lake stereotype  of Argentina right out of the  water. Here, the familiar tapestry of the  country&#8217;s European heritage  begins to unravel as the land rises up  towards the Andes. Through llama  herds and polychromatic ponchos, the  ancient cultures of the Andean  peoples reach down from Peru and  Bolivia, while some of the nation&#8217;s  oldest remnants of the conquering  Spanish can be found in heart-rending  folklore ballads and time-warped  adobe and wood churches.

The  city of Salta, with its slow pace  of life and colonial architecture, is  brimming with boutique hotels  and restaurants. It&#8217;s surrounded by  places offering every imaginable  adventure sport, from paragliding to  bungee jumping.

HotelsEl   Bordo de Las Lanzas
An   appealing blend of history and untainted beauty, this 400-year-old   estancia belongs to the Arias family, descendants of Salta&#8217;s patriot,   Mart&#237;n Miguel de G&#252;emes. Built in adobe and oak, the beautiful house has   eight en-suite rooms decorated with 17th- and 18th-century paintings   and furniture. Take it   easy by the pool or go gaucho and visit the local colony of yacaras   (alligators) on horseback. El Bordo&#8217;s location and facilities make it an   ideal base from which to explore the whole region, and with all meals   and activities included, it&#8217;s excellent value.

<em>El Bordo, 60km NE of Salta via Ruta 9 &amp;  Ruta  34. Rivadavia 298  (0387 490 3070, www.turismoelbordo.com.ar). &#163;&#163;&#163;.</em>

RestaurantsEl Nuevo Progreso
Offering  a perfect blend of  local atmosphere and fantastic food, this place is  hidden away from the  tourist hordes on the corner of Tilcara&#8217;s second  plaza. The rustic  wooden floor and whitewashed walls don&#8217;t prepare you  for the gourmet  delights created by the imaginative chef. Local  ingredients such as  llama, alfalfa, tomatoes and quinoa are used to  create delicious  traditional dishes. On many evenings, while locals  prop up the bar, a  duo of folk musicians arrives to strum and hum you  into an Andean  nirvana.

<em>Tilcara  Lavalle 351 (0388 495  5237). &#163;&#163;.</em>

Getting thereChevallier (011  4000 5255, www.nuevachevallier.com.ar), Flechabus (011  4000 5200,  www.flechabus.com.ar) and La Veloz del Norte (0800 444 8356, www.lavelozcallcenter.com.ar) run bus services from Salta to various   destinations nationwide, as well as to Bolivia and Chile.

There   are numerous daily flights from Salta&#8217;s Mart&#237;n Miguel de G&#252;emes airport   (RN 51, km 5, 0387 424 3115) to Buenos Aires. Aerolineas Argentinas   (0810 222 86527, www.aerolineas.com.ar) flies to Salta. For details of   connections to C&#243;rdoba and Iguaz&#250; from Salta, contact Andes L&#237;neas   A&#233;reas (0810 777 26337, www.andesonline.com).

When   to goSalta and Jujuy have sunshine and relatively warm   temperatures almost all year round. Rain in the areas around Salta city   can be persistent in summer (January to March); May and June are the   coldest months. Spring and early summer (September to December) are best   for warm weather and greener landscapes.

Dramatic landscapesEl CalafateJaw-dropping glaciers  amid the Patagonian wildernessEl Calafate, a small, remote town  in the province of Santa Cruz, is the base for visitors to Patagonia&#8217;s  most famous glacier, Glaciar Perito Moreno, one of the most wildly  impressive landscapes in Argentina. Seen from afar, it is breathtaking &#8211;  but it&#8217;s the chance to observe its spectacular, translucent bulk at  close range, gazing up at its frozen walls from a boat, from the nearby  walkway, or even standing on it, that makes a visit unforgettable.

From  a base in El Calafate, you can also visit other lesser-known glaciers,  such as the Upsala and the Spegazzini, or head off on horseback or in a  4x4 into the deserted mountains. You can fish for giant trout and visit  traditional Patagonian estancias, which seem lost in the immensity of  the steppe. Yet the main attraction for most visitors here remains the  celestial radiance of the glaciers &#8211; a thrilling universe unto  themselves.

HotelsCasa Los Sauces
Laid out  in the style of a Patagonian ranch, this member of the Small Luxury  Hotels of the World group features a decor of exposed stone walls and  striking paintings and sculptures. An observatory, a feng-shui spa, a  gourmet restaurant and splendid, large-windowed suites are key features.  Its location, handily close to the centre of town, is also a bonus.  However, the most interesting twist is that the hotel is owned by  Argentina&#8217;s power couple, N&#233;stor and Cristina Kirchner, the former and  current president, respectively.

<em>Los  Gauchos 1352 (02902 495854, www.casalossauces.com). &#163;&#163;&#163;&#163;.</em>

RestaurantsLa Tablita 
This is the best  known and also the oldest of the town&#8217;s parrillas, dating from 1968. Flavoursome Patagonian lamb is served, as well as incredibly  tender meat of both the red and white variety, and trout and salmon  dishes, all complemented by a very good wine list. For dessert, the  home-made Calafate berry ice-cream is highly recommended.

<em>Coronel  Rosales 28, opposite El Calafate bridge (02902 491065). &#163;&#163;&#163;.</em>

Getting  thereEl Calafate has a modern airport, and most visitors arrive  by air, sometimes by way of Bariloche or Tierra del Fuego. A smaller  number arrives by car along RN 40, from the north of Santa Cruz  province. There are comfortable buses, too, but distances are enormous.

When  to goYou can  visit all year round, but in June-September the temperature drops  considerably and the walkways alongside the glacier are sometimes  covered in snow. High season starts in November and lasts through to  April. It's always advisable to bring warm clothing.

Iguaz&#250;Roaring  waterfalls and  colourful wildlifeWhen it comes to destinations  to see before  you die, the Cataratas del Iguaz&#250; should rank near the  top of the list.  There&#8217;s nothing quite like this towering mass of spray  and sound, which  can be found straddling two countries amid 2,250  square kilometres of  parkland. Some 275 waterfalls punctuate this  stretch of river. At its  largest and most dramatic conjunction, the  water is churned into thick  creamy clouds that tumble through rainbows  of light. The resulting spray  rises for so many metres that, from a  distance, the falls can almost  seem to be travelling in two directions.

&#8216;Iguaz&#250;&#8217;  refers to the  attraction in its entirety, but it is usually divided  into four distinct  areas, with a small town and national park on each  side of the falls.  On the Argentinian side, Puerto Iguaz&#250; offers a  surprisingly tasteful  answer to a typical tourist town, while a few  kilometres east, Parque  Nacional Iguaz&#250; surrounds Argentina&#8217;s share of  the legendary falls. This  is not to be confused with Parque Nacional do  Igua&#231;u, which is the  Brazilian slice of the waterworks.

HotelsLoi  Suites Iguaz&#250;
Hidden in the Iryap&#250; jungle and  connected to Parque Nacional  Iguaz&#250;, Loi Suites Iguaz&#250;&#8217;s five buildings  are interconnected by  suspended bridges, elevated walkways and dirt  paths. The wildlife, even  seen from inside, seems so close it might  just take over the hotel. There are  154 elegantly-styled rooms with  jungle views, and eight beautiful  villas with outdoor jacuzzi tubs and  views of the R&#237;o Iguaz&#250;.

<em>Puerto  Iguaz&#250; Selva Iriap&#250;, no number (03757  498300,  www.loisuites.com.ar).  &#163;&#163;&#163;</em>.

RestaurantsLa  Rueda
Consistently  winning  rave reviews, this is the restaurant that locals are most  likely to  recommend. While  the menu offers the standard Argentinian meats and  asado selection, it&#8217;s  the excellent river fish, plucked fresh from  nearby tropical waters,  that is the main draw.

<em>Puerto Iguaz&#250; Avenida C&#243;rdoba 28  (03757  422531, www.larueda1975.com). &#163;&#163;&#163;.</em>

Getting  thereThree  flights a day to Puerto Iguaz&#250; are offered by both  Aerol&#237;neas  (www.aerolineas.com) and LAN (www.lan.com); the latter tends  to be  cheaper. Buses leave regularly from Buenos Aires to make the  18-hour  trip to Puerto Iguaz&#250;. From Posadas, a bus trip takes five to  six hours.  American and Australian visitors should note that they will  need a visa  to enter Brazil.

When to goA visit to  Iguaz&#250; is  likely to be rewarding at any time of year. In the milder  months of  October to December and April to June, you&#8217;ll enjoy a far  more pleasant  stroll through the trails and falls. But during the rainy  season of  November to March, you&#8217;ll see Iguaz&#250; at its torrential best.  Summer  (January to March) is hot and humid, but there is plenty of  wildlife.

MisionesWelcome to the  jungleIn  the extreme north-east of Argentina, Misiones' dense  forests fan out in all directions, a monotony of  lush green. Its sub-tropical topography is unique in Argentina and its   culture, in which indigenous and immigrant influences have collided and   combined, is as rich as its soil. There are rustic lodges in which to   unwind, Jesuit ruins to explore, remote waterfalls to discover and yerba   mate plantations to stroll through. Above all, there is the forest,   ancient yet fragile, whose dark interior exerts an irresistible   magnetism.

HotelsYacutinga Lodge
As much a labour of love as a   lodging, Yacutinga is set in a huge private reserve of Atlantic   rainforest that juts out into the R&#237;o Iguaz&#250;. A range of all-action   programmes are offered, the most popular of which is a two-nighter that   includes several guided walks and &#8211; the highlight &#8211; a kayaking   expedition on the broad, empty river, where kingfishers skim across the   glittering waters. But what really lifts  Yacutinga  on to the top shelf of South American eco-lodges is the zeal  and  expertise of its staff.

<em>60km E   of Puerto Iguaz&#250; near Colonia Andresito (03757 15 544493    mobile, www.yacutinga.com). &#163;&#163;&#163;&#163;.</em>

RestaurantsLa Querencia
Famous restaurants are  usually a  let-down, so by the time you&#8217;ve heard the tenth person tell  you that no  one who&#8217;s anyone passes through Misiones without eating at  La Querencia,  you&#8217;ll be girding yourself for disappointment. No chance.  This Posadas  institution is a terrific parrilla that specialises in  bringing patrons  more grilled protein than they could feasibly consume.  Try the chicken  galeto &#8211; stuffed thigh and breast with parma ham,  roast pepper and  chimichurri that comes sizzling on a huge spit.

<em>Posadas   Bol&#237;var 322 (03752 434955). &#163;&#163;.</em>

Getting thereMost   travellers arrive by plane. Misiones has two international airports &#8211;   Aeropuerto Internacional Puerto Iguaz&#250; (03757 421996), near Puerto   Iguaz&#250;, and General Jos&#233; de San Mart&#237;n (03752 457413), near Posadas.   Flights operate daily from both Buenos Aires (Aerol&#237;neas Argentinas and   LAN) and Salta (Andes L&#237;neas A&#233;reas). Those wishing to arrive by bus  can  choose from a number of reliable operators. We recommend Flechabus  (011  4000 5200, www.flechabus.com.ar), V&#237;a Bariloche (0800 333 7575,   www.viabariloche.com.ar) and Crucero del Norte (011 5258 5000,   www.crucerodelnorte.com.ar). It takes around 14 hours to get from BA to   Posadas, and around 18 hours to reach Puerto Iguaz&#250;.

When to   goMisiones is a year-round destination, with tourism peaking   in spring (October to December)&#8200;and autumn (April to June). It has a   subtropical climate, which means that there is no dry season. Expect   humidity and dampness, but not necessarily heat: owing to its altitude   and proximity to the Atlantic, Misiones can be bitterly cold in winter   (July to September) with night-time temperatures often dropping below   zero.

Parque Sierra de las QuijadasDramatic   red canyons and dinosaur footprintsParque Nacional Sierra de las  Quijadas makes an ideal  one-  or  two-night stopover on the way to  Mendoza, but its stunning    landscapes, friendly city and year-round sunny  climate will leave you    feeling it&#8217;s a lot more than just a detour.

A  barely noticeable  jagged  ridge on the horizon suggests little of the  majesty awaiting  visitors.  Million-year-old  tectonic  activity thrust this mass of rock above the  ground, allowing  water and  wind to shape it into a network of burnt-red  canyons and  valleys. In  the park&#8217;s centre, the rising land suddenly  collapses into  the Potrero  de la Aguada, a basin criss-crossed by dry  river beds and  surrounded  by cliff walls and temple-like rock  formations.

Nearby San Luis is a lively  provincial capital  that acts  as the  gateway to the park.

HotelsCampo   la Sierra
With its pleasant  grounds and   jovial German owner Bernardo, this ranch is a great place  to  experience  life in the green sierras just outside San Luis. The six   comfortable,  well-maintained cottages scattered throughout the wooded   property sleep  between two and eight people. Bernardo is an excellent   cook, producing  wholesome German dishes such as goulash or pork with   sauerkraut, which  he serves in his home in the evenings. Depending on   the season, you  may get the chance to savour local jabal&#237; (wild boar),   possibly  skewered by your host using one of his impressive collection  of  hunting  bows.

<em>San Luis Ruta 20, km 19.5, El  Volc&#225;n (02652   494171,  www.campolasierra.com.ar). &#163;&#163;.</em>

RestaurantsLos  Robles
Los Robles is  a bastion of   excellence in San Luis; every local will point you in  its direction if   you ask for a recommendation. There is a faultless parrilla, as well  as a selection of   dishes that are hard to find in these parts, such as  a fantastic seafood   casserole and scallops. The  temperature-controlled wine cellar has the   best selection in San Luis,  with some excellent vintages.

<em>San   Luis Col&#243;n 684 (02652 436767). &#163;&#163;&#163;.</em>

Getting    thereA number of bus companies run daily services between    Buenos Aires and the San Luis bus station (Avenida Espa&#241;a 990, 02652    424021), and other destinations. Try CATA (02615 241699,    www.catainternacional.com) or Auto Transporte San Juan (02652 424998,    www.atsj.com.ar). San Luis is about eight hours 30 minutes from Buenos    Aires by bus, and three hours from Mendoza. There is one flight per day    from Buenos Aires to San Luis&#8217;s airport (Avenida Fuerza A&#233;rea 3095,    02652 422427) with Aerol&#237;neas Argentinas (0810 2228 6527,    www.aerolineas.com.ar).

When to goSan Luis has a dry continental climate,  with   year-round sunshine. The best times to visit are October to  December   and April to June. From January to March, occasional    temperatures of up to 42&#176;C and  heavy rain can cause the park to close.

Mountains and lakesBariloche, El Bols&#243;n &amp; Villa La AngosturaPatagonia&#8217;s stunning lake districtThe massive national parkland surrounding the towns of San Carlos de Bariloche, Villa La Angostura and El Bols&#243;n display natural Andean drama in its rawest form. Standing thousands of metres over the plains, rock faces obscure even the higher summits of ice-capped volcanoes; turbid rivers carry glacial spring water to vast turquoise lakes in the valleys below; shores are stitched with forests that shelter some of the rarest trees on the planet, the arrayanes.

Each town in this region offers a different kind of experience. Bariloche is not only the gateway to Argentina&#8217;s first national park, Parque Nacional Nahuel Huapi, and the world-famous serpentine Ruta de los Siete Lagos (Seven Lakes route), but it is also one of Argentina&#8217;s top tourist centres, with an advanced infrastructure that supports year-round activities. Villa La Angostura is a smaller version of Bariloche, with equally high levels of dining and accommodation. El Bols&#243;n is the laid-back member of this mountainous triumvirate, and still reflects the influence of the hippie squatters who first dreamed of creating an ecological haven here in the 1970s.

Nestled among forests, rivers and mountains, this small, intimate wooden eco-lodge is the perfect place to connect with the natural world. The rooms are small and basic, but the emphasis is more on the communal areas, such as the large lounge with fireplace, the reading spaces and the outdoor deck overlooking the R&#237;o Azul. The lodge also has a spa, log-fired saunas and outdoor hot tubs, overlooked by the snow-covered mountains.

<em>El Bols&#243;n R&#237;os Encanto Blanco &amp; Azul, Mall&#237;n Ahogado&#160; (02944 498375,  www.laconfluencia.com). &#163;&#163;.</em>

RestaurantsTinto Bistro
Tinto Bistro is famed locally for being the restaurant owned by Princess M&#225;xima of the Netherlands&#8217; younger brother, Mart&#237;n Zorreguieta. Co-owner and chef Leanardo Andres prepares eclectic dishes with Asian and Mediterranean influences, as well as dressed-up regional fare. The restaurant offers the best gourmet experience in town, and there is also an ample wine selection to accompany the fusion dishes.

<em>Villa La Angostura Nahuel Huapi 34 (02944 494924). &#163;&#163;&#163;.</em>

Getting thereBoth Aerolineas Argentinas and LAN offer flights throughout the year to Aeropuerto Internacional Bariloche (02944 426162). Buses run regularly from Buenos Aires, but it is a 22-hour trip.

When to goJuly and August are perfect for winter sports, and the summer months, December and January, are great for hiking in the national parks.

MendozaA land of mountains  and wineWine is big business both here and in the valleys all around. The  province ranks, alongside San Juan, as the country&#8217;s primary  wine-producing region.

But  this attractive town and its surrounding region aren&#8217;t just for  wine-lovers. The mountains and valleys are awash with opportunities for  nature- and adventure-lovers to enjoy their ultimate holiday pursuit,  whether it be climbing to the top of Cerro Aconcagua, the continent&#8217;s  highest peak; ambling on horseback through the peaceful valleys; or  rafting in the rushing waters of the R&#237;o Mendoza.

HotelsCavas Wine Lodge
A  20-minute drive from central Mendoza brings you to this serene country  house, with a spectacular view of the Andes. Cecilia D&#237;az Chuit, Cavas&#8217;s  owner, worked for high-end international hotel chains before launching  her own elegant enterprise. Her husband, Mart&#237;n Rigal, is the wine  expert. There are 14 hectares of bonarda vines to set you dreaming, and  an underground cava (cellar) stacked with dozens of notable Argentinian  labels to top you up. If you can&#8217;t get enough of the grape, try a  vino-therapy bath or grape-seed exfoliation in the spa. (Guests receive a  complimentary massage.) The private caba&#241;as each  have their own roof deck, private plunge pool and alfresco shower.

<em>Luj&#225;n de Cuyo Costaflores, Alto  Agrelo M 5507 (0261 410 6927,  www.cavaswinelodge.com). &#163;&#163;&#163;&#163;.</em>

Restaurants1884
Celebrity chef  Francis Mallman&#8217;s restaurant is located inside the atmospheric,  Romanesque Bodega Escorihuela. Mallman put Argentinian haute cuisine on  the map with dishes such as kid or salted chicken baked in mud ovens,  and there&#8217;s an impressive 36-page wine list. The whole place has an  upbeat, energetic atmosphere; come to savour the flavours, or combine  your meal with a tour of the bodega and art gallery.

<em>Mendoza  Belgrano 1188, &amp; Godoy Cruz (0261 424 2698). &#163;&#163;&#163;.</em>

Getting  thereMendoza&#8217;s airport, El Plumerillo, has regular  connections to Buenos Aires. Aerol&#237;neas Argentinas  (www.aerolineas.com.ar) and LAN (www.lan.com) offer daily flights. There  are daily buses from Mendoza&#8217;s bus station, Terminal del Sol (Avenida  de Acceso Este and Costanera, Guaymall&#233;n), to major destinations,  including Buenos Aires, Bariloche and Santiago de Chile.

When to goMendoza  has dry summers with wetter winters. Average temperatures for January  (summer) are 35&#176;C during the day, and 23&#176;C at night. Temperatures for  July (winter) are 12&#176;C by day, and 3&#176;C at night.

Rivers and wetlandsEsteros del Iber&#225;A watery wonderland  brimming with biodiversityYou&#8217;ll find peace in Esteros del  Iber&#225;, but not quiet. The air is filled with a rich and raucous  polyphony of squawks, burps, splashes, howls and bizarre whirring  noises, the concerted effort of more than 350 types of bird, plus dozens  of rare and exotic species of mammal, reptile and amphibian.

The  pit in which this natural orchestra plays is the second-largest wetland  in the world, after Brazil&#8217;s Pantanal, and covers 14 per cent of  Corrientes province. Once part of the main stream of the R&#237;o Paran&#225;,  Esteros del Iber&#225; is now a subtly shifting &#8211; and steam-iron flat &#8211;  terrain of lakes, marshes, savannah and floating islands. The reserve  lacks asphalt roads, chain hotels, fast-food restaurants, cable  television access and reliable mobile-phone coverage. And those are just  five of its virtues.

HotelsPosada de la Laguna
The  pick of the accommodation in Carlos Pellegrini, Posada de la Laguna is  exactly what it says it is &#8211; a country lodge next to the lake. Set in a  spacious private park, the property consists of two elegant,  vine-covered buildings &#8211; one housing a comfortable living room and  dining area, the other offering six airy guest rooms giving out on to a  colonnaded veranda. Between motor launch and kayak excursions on the  lake, guests can take a dip in the pool or bird-watch from a hammock on  the veranda as woodpeckers, yellow flycatchers, southern screamer  vultures and many other species flit and strut around the park.

<em>Colonia Carlos Pellegrini  (03773 499413, www.posadadelalaguna.com).  &#163;&#163;&#163;&#163;.</em>

RestaurantsRinc&#243;n del Socorro (03782  497172) is an estancia whose kitchen turns out minor masterpieces of  rustic cuisine. Most of what ends up on the plate comes from their  organic garden.

Getting thereFlechabus operates several  daily bus services to Mercedes from BA&#8217;s Retiro station (011 4000 5200,  www.flechabus.com.ar). Alternatively, take the 90-minute flight from the capital to  Posadas and then to proceed to Colonia Carlos Pellegrini by taxi or, for  those with experience driving on dirt roads, by hire car.

Getting  from Mercedes to Colonia Carlos Pellegrini presents the biggest  challenge. A taxi ride along the 110 kilometres of RP 40 will take  approximately two hours and set you back around AR$400. El Rayo (office  at the Mercedes bus station, 03773 420184) and Itat&#237; II (03773 421342)  both run bus services from Mercedes to Carlos Pellegrini, leaving at  around 12.30pm. The journey takes at least three hours 30 minutes and  often longer, as the buses are poorly maintained and prone to breaking  down. In theory, there is a return service from Carlos Pellegrini to  Mercedes twice daily; in practice, you should always have a back-up  option.

When  to goEsteros del Iber&#225; is a year-round destination with a subtropical  climate, which means heavy rains and high temperatures are possible at  any time, even though you should pack a fleece for cold nighttimes.  January and February can be particularly torrid with temperatures often climbing above 40&#176;C.

TigreCharming Victorian town at the mouth of an idyllic river deltaMost visitors to Tigre come directly from Buenos Aires, and at less than an hour north of the capital by train, the trip leaves little time for the mental transition from city chaos to hushed tranquillity. Tigre is a small, charming town with leafy Victorian neighbourhoods, a whistle-stop on the way into the magnificent Delta del Paran&#225;. On its doorstep lies a sweeping, exotic labyrinth of verdant isles, narrow estuaries and secluded homes and lodgings.

HotelsHotel Villa Victoria
The latest project from Argentinian/Swedish owners Alicia and Bjorn, this charming, petite hotel is a recent arrival in Tigre. Each of the five suites in this immaculately restored estate opens out on to a scenic pool-view patio and features eclectic art and tasteful furnishings. Ask for the Victoria Suite, whose atmospheric fireplace and massive bathroom raise it a notch above the other rooms.

<em>Liniers 566 (011 4731 2281/011 15 601 61296 mobile,  www.hotelvillavictoria.com). &#163;&#163;.</em>

RestaurantsIl Novo Mar&#237;a del Luj&#225;n
Situated along the R&#237;o Luj&#225;n, opposite a crumbling Victorian mansion, this is the most noteworthy eaterie in town. Formerly a grand family estate, the luxurious riverside restaurant has an atmospheric interior, although the spacious patio is what draws the crowds. The upscale but inexpensive cuisine includes good-quality seafood and traditional Argentinian fare. The wine list is excellent.

<em>Paseo Victorica 611, &amp; Vito Dumas (011 4731 9613,  www.ilnovomariadellujan.com). &#163;&#163;.</em>

Getting thereTake city bus number 60 from Plaza Constituci&#243;n in Buenos Aires for a 90-minute ride through the city to downtown Tigre. Another option is to take the Mitre line train from Retiro; trains leave every 15 minutes from 5am to midnight Monday to Saturday, and from 6am to 11.30pm on Sundays and bank holidays. A more scenic rail option is the Tren de la Costa, a coastal light railway that picks up passengers in the town of Olivos and travels through the upscale riverside suburbs north of Buenos Aires, terminating in Tigre.

When to goMarch and November are the months with the most pleasant temperatures. Tigre is in full bloom (and more than a little overcrowded) in Argentina&#8217;s sticky late-spring and summer months of December to February, when porte&#241;os head for the cool waterways. June to August can get downright cold.

Rural escapesLas Sierras de C&#243;rdobaHills made for  relaxation and adventureThey may not compare to the Andean  cordillera in strict terms of height, but ask a porte&#241;o what he thinks  about the sierras of C&#243;rdoba, and you&#8217;ll find they loom large in the  Argentinian imagination. Conveniently close to the province&#8217;s capital  city of C&#243;rdoba, these hills and valleys have called out to urban  dwellers for generations.

Visitors come here to have asados at  the caba&#241;as that dot the roadsides in the Valle de Punilla, or to ride  horses through tall tufts of pampa grass in the Sierra Chica. The more  adventurous might climb Cerro Champaqu&#237;, the province&#8217;s tallest peak,  while those looking to relax simply marvel at the majestic Sierra Grande  from the Valle de Traslasierra below. Meanwhile, hidden throughout the  hills, behind nondescript fences and at the ends of nameless rock-strewn  roads, wonderful Cordob&#233;s hospitality and delicious food await in  estancias, in as relaxing an environment as you&#8217;ll find anywhere.

HotelsEstancia la Paz
Once  the rural  retreat of Argentinian president Julio Argentino Roca,  Estancia la Paz  is now an opulent 20-room hotel. The history of its  former owner lends  an irony to the name: la Paz means &#8216;the peace&#8217;, but  Roca led the  massacre of innumerable indigenous Patagonians during his  1879  &#8216;Campaign of the Desert&#8217;. Still, the grounds are indeed peaceful,   particularly when strolling around the 70-hectare park. Estancia La Paz   has all the usual luxuries &#8211; spa, tennis court, swimming pool &#8211; as well   as two polo fields and a few horses.

<em>14km NW of Jes&#250;s Mar&#237;a RP 66, km  14 (03525 492073,  www.estancialapaz.com). &#163;&#163;&#163;&#163;.</em>

RestaurantsEl Faro
The  reputation of  this parrilla, widely agreed to be the best in the  province of C&#243;rdoba,  is fully deserved. Many residents of the provincial  capital drive the  60km north to eat the beef here &#8211; despite the fact  that the nephew of  El Faro&#8217;s owner has since opened up a branch with an  identical menu in  C&#243;rdoba city.

<em>Jes&#250;s  Mar&#237;a Juan Bautista Alberdi 245 (03525 466258). &#163;&#163;.</em>

Getting thereFrequent  daily flights from  Buenos Aires to C&#243;rdoba&#8217;s international airport are  offered by  Aerol&#237;neas Argentinas (www.aerolineas.com.ar) and LAN  (www.lan.com).  C&#243;rdoba&#8217;s Terminal de Omnibus (Boulevard Juan D Per&#243;n  380, 0351 428  4141) is well served by national intercity buses. The bus  journey from  Buenos Aires to C&#243;rdoba city takes ten hours.

When to goHigh season is from December to March, when popular  parts of the sierra fill up. There are hot days in summer (January to  March) and cold ones in   winter (July to September), but, overall, the  weather in the sierras   is temperate year-round. Rain in the summer  months is typically   minimal.

                                                            I highly highly recommend traveling to Patagonia in Argentina. The landscape there is unlike anything I've ever seen - rugged mountains, ancient glaciers, and incredible wildlife. You can see a short video of my travels here: https://youtu.be/VgNUGe7VqNc

                                                            Argentina does has so much to offer.  We spent over two months traveling around the country and would HIGHLY recommend spending more time in Patagonia and avoiding Mendoza.
