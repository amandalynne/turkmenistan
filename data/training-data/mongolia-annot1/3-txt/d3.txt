					Gorkhi-Terelj National Park


The Gorkhi-Terelj National Park is among most frequented tourist places in the country.

It has a number of tourist camps to accommodate its visitors, and a small portion at its southern part was specially developed for tourists; it features souvenir shops and restaurants.


At the park, visitors can indulge in horse riding, camel riding, and ger camping (a ger is a Mongolian tent). Other attractions at the park are the Tuul River, a Buddhist monastery, the Yestii Hot Water Springs, and a deep glacial lake known as the Khagiin Khar Lake. You will also find hundreds of species of wildlife here, including birds and brown bears.


There are two popular rock formations that can be found at the park: the Turtle Rock and the Old Man Reading a Book. These two rock formations were named after the images they resemble.


The park has been featured at the US reality television program <em>The Amazing Race</em> at an episode on its 10th season.


Hotel Mongolia


When you are in Ulaanbaatar and you are seeking the kind of comfort that only a luxury hotel can provide, you might want to check out the closest thing you can find to a luxury hotel in the area &#173;&#8211; Hotel Mongolia.


The hotel is situated along the picturesque banks of River Tuul and has a walled camp. Tibetan architecture is proudly displayed both in the hotel&#8217;s exterior design and in its interior furnishings.


Accommodations at the hotel include stone gers, traditional gers, temple rooms, as well as regular suites.


If you&#8217;re seeking relaxation, you can find it at the river beach and in the spa, where you can get invigorating massages. The hotel also offers a day trip to the Terelj and Khustain national parks, a city trip of Ulaanbaatar, a visit to a Nomadic family, mountain trekking, and jet boating.


It is vital to note, though, that this hotel is not open during the winter season.


Choijin Lama Temple


While touring Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, you may want to drop by at the Choijin Lama Temple, a Buddhist monastery that also gives a fine sample of the architecture of this country.


The site is actually a complex of four temples. The main temple holds a large collection of dance masks, religious instruments, and paintings.


The Zuu Temple has papier-m&#226;ch&#233; Buddha figures. The Yidam temple is closed to the public. The temple of peace, the fourth temple, is dedicated to Undur Gegeen Zanabazar, who lived from 1635 to 1724 and was believed to be a reincarnation of Boghda Jevzundamba.


Construction of the complex was from 1904 to 1908. In 1938, the temple complex was converted into a museum by the Stalinist government.


Bogd Khan Palace Museum


The Bogd Khan Palace Museum used to be the residence of the person after whom it was named: the eighth Bogd Jebtsundamba Agvnluvsanchoijinnimadanzanbanchugwas, more popularly known as Bogd Khan (emperor).


Bogd Khan was born in 1869 and was declared a reincarnation of Bogd Jebtsundamba Khutugtu, who had been a spiritual leader in the country. In 1911, he became Mongolia&#8217;s religious and political leader. He remained so even after the revolution in 1921, although his monarchy became restricted. He died in 1924 due to ill health


After his death, his palace was turned into a museum. As of now, however, still only 13% of the museum treasures have been displayed to the public. A new building is being planned to house and display more of the available treasures for exhibit.


Bayanzag


Bayanzag is popularly called the Flaming Cliffs due to the glowing orange color of its rocks when viewed from a distance. It is a part of the Gobi Desert, situated in the &#214;mn&#246;govi Province.


The site is well known not just among tourists but more so among paleontologists. Since the 1920s, there have been quite a number of dinosaur fossils found at the site, the most famous of which are some dinosaur eggs. Fossils of other dinosaur species such as the small (less than two feet high) Velociraptor have also been made.


But even if you&#8217;re not interested in digging for dinosaur bones, the site is still well worth a visit simply for the view, which is breathtaking.
