One of the most attractive areas of Peru to visit, the Manu National Park rainforest contains an incredible richness of animals and plants. Although not allowed inside the actual park itself, you can visit the Reserved Zone on the Manu Adventurer tour from Puerto Maldonado or on some of the combination Amazon tours available from Cusco.


At 1.7 million hectares, this is the largest national park in Peru and one of the most magnificent sections of Amazon Rainforest to visit for nature lovers. Animals are free to move passed the park boundary and into adjoining forest where you can find the Manu Wildlife Center. Because of its fantastic position, this lodge provides higher chances of seeing some of the larger and more iconic wildlife than in Manu&#8217;s Reserved Zone.
