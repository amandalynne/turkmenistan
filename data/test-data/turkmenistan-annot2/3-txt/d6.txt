Ahal Region

Ashgabat is located in Ahal region, as well as the Kopetdag Mountains and the southern parts of the Karakum Desert. Traveling west takes you to mountain villages, a network of underground lakes and moon-like landscapes, where four-wheel drives are the mode of long-distance transportation, accommodation is in basic homestays or camp style, where (multiple-)day walking tours and birdwatchers visit. Traveling east takes you to sites that reflect the region's importance during the medieval Silk Road period and human presence as early as the Bronze Age, where archeological teams are active in excavations. Serakhs provides another entry point into Iran. Traveling north takes you straight into the Karakum Desert, which makes it excellent terrain for jeep safaris, but also horse riding treks. The Tejen River and The Karakum Canal traverse the region and have provided the necessary irrigation for agricultural activity: driving along the foothills of the Kopetdag you will see fields of grain and cotton, vineyards, and fruit and vegetable plantations, as well as processing plants.

Kopetdag Mountains and the lunar landscapes

The mountains form a natural border with Iran, hosts some unique protected flora, birds and mammals, and some bizarre lunar-like landscapes. The Sumbar river area runs through the range.

The dry and sub-tropical climatic conditions lead to an abundance of wild and cultivated forms of vegetation, such as pomegranate, fig, pistachio and walnut. As a result of ancient volcanic activity west of the region, barren lunar-like hills, deprived of any form of vegetation, form a unique contrast to these fertile landscapes.

Murzachirla and Akmolla

A cluster of authentic desert settlements, located in low basins in the heart of the central Karakum, accessible only by four-wheel drive, and requiring camp style overnight.

Due to their remoteness and limited influence from modern urban development, hospitality, local traditions and nomadic lifestyle features continue to play a decisive role in these communities. While sleepy during the daytime heat, the villages come to life at sunrise and sunset.

Darwaza

The center of a gas-rich area in the heart of the Karakum desert attracts travelers from all over the world because of its unique burning crater, that offers a particularly spectacular view in the dark.

In the early seventies, an underground cavern filled with natural gas was identified here, remained unexploited, and therefore today looks like a large circular 60-m wide hole with hundreds of fires burning inside, some of them with flames up to 10-15 m high.
