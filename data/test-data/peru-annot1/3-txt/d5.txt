There is MUCH more to Peru than Machu Picchu
By Traveling Canucks
Posted in: Adventures, Peru, South America, Travel Stories, Trip Ideas, World Attractions, World Heritage Site 


There is MUCH more to Peru than Machu Picchu
We&#8217;ll be the first to admit that the main reason we visited Peru was to experience the world famous Incan city of Machu Picchu. After all, it is a new Seven Wonder of the World and has become one of the most recognizable tourist attractions on the planet.


Like many before us, our goal was to hike the legendary Inca Trail to Machu Picchu.&#160;The challenging 4-day trek has become one of the most memorable experiences we&#8217;ve had overseas.&#160;It&#8217;s the primary reason that Peru has become one of our favourite countries!


Although Machu Picchu gets all the fame and glory (and for good reason), there is so much more to do in Peru.


10 Things to do in Peru other than Machu Picchu 


1. Explore the Amazon Rainforest 
Did you know that Peru has the second largest amount of Amazon Rainforest after Brazil? &#160;The Peruvian Amazon covers 60% of the country, creating a unique and diverse ecosystem when combined with the mighty Andean Mountain range and Pacific Ocean.


The two main entry points into the Amazon Basin from Peru are Iquitos and Puerto Maldonado. It is recommended to fly to both regions because of rough road infrastructure.


We traveled from Cusco to Puerto Maldonado, where we transferred to a river boat that took us 3 hours upriver to an isolated jungle lodge along the banks of the Tambopata River.


There is something eerie, yet peaceful, about sleeping in an open cabin in the middle of the Amazon Jungle, while howler monkeys chant in the distance and quite rain drops hit the thatched roof.


2. Hike the Colca Canyon 
Even if hiking is not your thing, witnessing the beauty of the Colca Canyon should not be missed. Along with its spectacular scenery, the Colca Canyon&#8217;s claim to fame is that it&#8217;s twice as deep as the Grand Canyon in the United States, though the walls are not as vertical or dramatic.


The region is also well known as the home of the rare Andean Condor, an enormous bird with the largest wing span of any land bird, at 3.2 meters.


It&#8217;s easy to book overnight trekking and/or sightseeing tours from Arequipa, Peru&#8217;s second largest city.&#160;The journey passes through remarkable volcano country, at heights&#160;as high as 4,900 meters, before descending into the stunning, lush Colca Valley below.


There are several mountain villages in the valley but the most popular with tourists is the town of Chivay, celebrated for its natural hot springs and dramatic views.


3. Tour the Floating Islands of Lake Titicaca 
Aside from having the title as being the highest commercially navigable lake in the world, Lake Titicaca is famous for its floating reed islands.&#160;The islands are home to the Uros tribe, one that pre-dates the Incan civilization.


Though quite a popular tourist attraction in Peru, touring the floating islands offers an interesting perspective into the lives of Peru&#8217;s aboriginal people. It&#8217;s a weird feeling the first time you step on an island made entirely of reeds!


The best way to travel to Lake Titicaca is to take the bus from Cusco to Puno (assuming you visit after exploring Machu Picchu) or from Arequipa.&#160;You don&#8217;t need to make reservations ahead of time because it&#8217;s easy to book day trips to the floating islands from the&#160;city of Puno.


4. Fly over the mysterious Nazca Lines 
Located in the Nazca Desert plains, the peculiar Nazca Lines are a series of ancient geoglyphs that range from wildlife to geometric designs.&#160; There are several theories about how and why the geoglyphs were created but it seems nothing is conclusive. Regardless, the Nazca Lines are clearly one of Peru&#8217;s most interesting and peculiar attractions.


The best way to view these extraordinary designs is by air, though be prepared for some added adventure because the planes are small! &#160;You can book airplane tours of the Nazca Lines from Lima, Ica and Nazca.


5. Sandboarding giant sand dunes&#160;in Huacachina 
Huacachina is located just outside the city of Ica, about 4.5 hours south of Lima and 10 hours from Arequipa (by tourist class bus).&#160; The&#160;desert village is built around a small natural lake with towering sand dunes surrounding it from all sides.


The Peruvian desert oasis&#160;has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction for adventurers drawn to sand boarding and high speed dune buggy rides (we highly recommend you visit!).


Sand boarding Tip: Use an old snowboard with proper bindings and boots if available &#8211; you can usually find boards at hostels and hotels.&#160;Otherwise you&#8217;re likely to be strapped to a heavy wooden plank with poor control. And watch your speed; falling leads to unwanted mouthfuls of sand!


6. Surfing Mancora 
Where&#8217;s the best place to  surf in Peru ? Well, that depends on who you ask!&#160; Located on the Pacific coast of Peru, the beach town of Mancora is famed for its pristine beaches, great surf and chilled out atmosphere.  


If beach lounging and catching waves are your thing, Mancora is calling you. 


It&#8217;s also a great stop on the popular South America backpacking trail along the Pan-American Highway. To travel to Mancora&#160;by tourist bus from Guayaquil, Ecuador is about 7 hours. It&#8217;s an 18-hour bus from&#160;Lima to Mancora, so bring a pillow!


7. Discover the Sacred Valley of the Incas 
Though Machu Picchu is the clear fan favourite when it comes to Incan archaeology, the Sacred Valley is a must for history buffs and cultural connoisseurs. Geographically, the Sacred Valley stretches along the Urubamba River from Pisac to Ollantaytambo. Aside from the ruins and archaeological sites, the region is well known for its remarkable landscapes and lush agriculture.


Guided tours of the Sacred Valley can be organized from Cusco, the ancient capital of the Incan Empire, and can include river rafting, horseback riding, mountain biking and hiking. There are also several historical Incan sites and unique attractions within Cusco, giving you plenty to do while you acclimatize to the high altitude of the region.


8.  Witness the wildlife of the Ballestas Islands 
The Islas Ballestas are accessible from the beach town of Paracas (near Pisco) by tour boat, typically lasting about&#160;2 hours. Often described as  the Galapagos Islands  of Peru, the islands are home to many rare birds, including pelicans, penguins, cormorants, Peruvian boobies, and Inca terns. It&#8217;s also common to spot sea lions, turtles, dolphins , and whales in the park.


Next to the Amazon Rainforest, the Ballestas Islands and Paracas National Reservation offer the best wildlife experience in Peru. Due to its ideal location on the Pacific coast, day trips can be made while you explore the sand dunes of Huacachina or fly over the Nazca Lines.


9. Sightseeing in Lima 
Often used as the &#8216;layover&#8217; en route to Cusco, Peru&#8217;s largest metropolitan&#160;city typically gets overlooked. Though it does have a bad reputation for safety, Lima is extremely rich in history and culture.&#160;It has great museums, historical cathedrals, eerie catacombs, tasty traditional Peruvian cuisine, electric nightlife and endless shopping.


Don&#8217;t miss the bluffs&#160;at Miraflores and its spectacular Pacific ocean views!


10. Trekking the Cordillera Blanca in Huaraz 
Huaraz is located in north-central Peru, about 420&#160;km north of Lima. It is the gateway to the Cordillera Blanca, the highest range of the Peruvian Andes and famous for its magnificent snowcapped peaks and glaciers.


The Cordillera Blanca includes Huascar&#225;n, the highest mountain in Peru at 6,768&#160;metres (22,205 ft) and the third highest in the Western Hemisphere. It is arguably the best place in South America for trekking and mountain climbing expeditions.


~~~~~~~~


So what&#8217;s the lesson learned? 


There is much more to Peru than Machu Picchu! But make sure you&#160;visit Machu Picchu&#160;too &#8211; it&#8217;s well worth it and definitely lives up to the hype.  


And if you&#8217;re the adventurous type, we recommend you hike the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. To this day, it&#8217;s one of our favourite hikes!

We did our own 2 week trek in the Cordillera Blanca with 2 donkeys &amp; a donkey driver quite some time ago. The countryside was amazing and we didn&#8217;t see a westerner for 10 days. The trip was dirt cheap too &#8211; $20/day for the donkeys +driver. We provided all the meals but it was the bargain of the century.

I stayed at that eco-lodge on the Tambopata River and I can say that it was one of my finest traveling experiences. We woke before dawn to catch the sunrise from the canopy tower. It was worth the early rise because every animal and bird in the jungle was up and squawking as the sun rose. Magnificent.

Having done 8 of those 10 (I just missed the amazon &amp; mancora &#8211; good enough reasons to go back!) I totally agree. But I reckon there&#8217;s one major Peruvian highlight you missed &#8211; the fact that the country has the best food in South America!

Don&#8217;t forget the Manu National Reserve, Peru&#8217;s largest national park. Amazing biodiversity, less well known than Iquitos and Puerto Maldonado. While we were there, we were the only people staying in our lodge. And it&#8217;s a day&#8217;s trip by land from Cuzco &#8211; makes it easier to see Machu Picchu and the jungle all in one trip.

Thanks Marcello! We just scratched the surface too. There is so much to do in Peru but these are the heavy hitters. Lake Titicaca is interesting and beautiful, but you don&#8217;t need to spend too much time there (I&#8217;d spend more time in the Colca Canyon, Pacific Coast and the Amazon &#8211; but that&#8217;s just personal preference!)

Great post&#8230; and so true. I think I enjoyed the Amazon the most&#8230; although I was sick as a dog when we were in Aguas Calentes from a hamburger of death I ate in the Sacred Valley. Nazca was amazing too&#8230; although I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d go back. That was a LONG bus ride; but there again, I was still pretty sick.

Sorry for the delayed response Juliana &#8211; I would reckon you need at least 3 weeks. You could visit most of these places in two weeks but it would be very rushed.

You totally nailed it! Machu Picchu is definitely the jewel of Peru, but there is a surprisingly vast amount of things to see and do in this country. The beaches of the north, the amazon, the ancient ruins EVERYWHERE&#8230;.did you manage to get to the museum in Lambayeque? The artifacts there are AMAZING!

Oh man, no one has mentioned Kuelap (the Lost City of the Cloud People) up in Chachapoyas (north&#8230;via Chiclayo). Even in Chiclayo there are awesome things to see, like the largest witches market in all of South America (!!! Awesome!!) but Kuelap&#8230;.my word. I cannot sing it&#8217;s praises enough. It is essentially like a northern version of Machu Picchu but hardly anyone goes there as it&#8217;s still under excavation. It&#8217;s situated on a mountain top and when we went there, it was just three of us, a team of archaeologists working, and a bunch of llamas. Absolutely BREATH.TA.KING. If you go, stay in Estancia El Chillo. It&#8217;s a great family run hacienda in a beautiful and convenient jumping off location to see Kuelap and the other sights. There are a number of tour companies that can take you there.

Heather, I agree 100%. I was surprised to see it was not mentioned and was delighted to see you bring this up. On our entire 1st year of our RTW trip Kuelap ranks as one of the top things we experienced. We trekked for 4 days in and saw so many of the Chachapoyian ruins along the way. Then, getting up the mountain to see the Kuelap ruins was breathtaking. If I could go back and do one thing in Peru this would be it every year, just to see the archaeological progress as they uncover more of this site.

Bookmarked this post as we&#8217;re heading over Ecuador so articles like this can only tempt us to look more closely at other parts of South America.

PN Huascar&#225;n is one of the best playgrounds for climbers, trekkers and alpinists in all of South America. It is also one of the least expensive places to learn how to ice climb in the Americas. When you send a picture home of you ice climbing in Per&#250; people won&#8217;t believe it and say &#8220;I thought that Peru was all rain forest and jungle&#8221; or something along those lines. Good post guys.

It&#8217;s possible, but it will be a very full day. 


Huacachina is a lot of fun, we recommend you stay at least one night (but careful&#8230; you might end up staying for 3 or 4 nights!)

Hey I&#8217;m planning a backpacking trip to Peru with a few of my mates after our exams summer 2013, this article&#8217;s been a great help picking out the sites to visit, what are prices like over there? We&#8217;ll have to start saving now so could you say what a safe amount to have available for us is if we&#8217;re going for 4 weeks, staying at cheap locations though trying to do as much as possible? I know its vague question but any estimates would be much appreciated. How long did you go for and how much was it?

I wasn&#8217;t too impressed with Paracas the National Reservation or Islas Ballestas. It wasn&#8217;t bad but all in all the quiet town left a bit to be desired. Lima is a great place to visit, I haven&#8217;t been to the rest but I plan on moving there for a few months towards the end of next year.

We are making a list referring to your site and comments from people on your site. We are alotting ourselves about a month here and will likely do most of what you and your friends recommend.

Nice choices!!!! I would also include a trip to Northern Peru with a visit to Kuelap fortress, Gocta waterfall (third highest in the world), Karajia funerary site and the demanding but amazing trek to Lake of the Condors. You should also visit the pre Inca aqueduct of Cumbemayo in Cajamarca and the archaeological sites In Chiclayo and Trujillo (Chan Chan, Sipan, El Brujo). Personally i find that the best of the northern region is that it is an almost virgin region. Take a look to some photos on my site: http://www.peruviansoul.com/28/destinations/northern-kingdoms.html Cheers, Diego.

We are a group of 6 adults who are looking at doing the Inca Trail in September this year, just not sure what do to afterwards. Feel like relaxing on a beach somewhere &#8211; just not sure if Mancora is the best option &#8211; have heard mixed reviews. Possibly go to Brazil &#8211; Paraty and/or Ilha Grande?

If you want to stay in Peru I would suggest visiting Huacachina &#8211; it&#8217;s not a beach per se, but its an oasis surrounded by sand.

If you want to visit another country it might be fun to have a layover in Costa Rica or Panama &#8211; the beaches on the Caribbean are hard to beat.

Great article, Peru really is such an amazing destination and it&#8217;s a shame that most visitors fly in for Machu Picchu and then back out before getting the chance to really explore. The only item that I would say you missed is not a place but an experience, that&#8217;s the cuisine of Peru. In my opinion it&#8217;s definitely one of the top destinations for foodies in the world. Nothing says Peru like a piece of llama, or cuy with a glass of Inka Kola.

Hello,

I am highly considering Peru for a vacation.

I like the list you guys pieced together.sounds fun!

I&#8217;ve seen others ask how much they should consider to spend with leniency in consideration so I don&#8217;t run out or spend too much. How much should I consider spending? Along with flight, hotels, food, souvenirs, and transportation. Also, for how long?

Hey David &#8211; thanks for your comment.

Budgeting for a trip is tricky, especially because we don&#8217;t know much about you or your travel style. I also don&#8217;t know where you are flying from, so that will impact flight costs &#8211; as will the season/time of year you are flying.

Tell us more about your plan and we will do our best to help out.

Cheers!

Altitude effects people differently, and we do not know enough about you or your kids. As such, we are not qualified to answer this question. I would talk to your doctor first. 


We did not experience any altitude sickness, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you will have the same experience.

It really depends on what you are looking to do and how you like to travel. If you are doing budget travel and staying in hostels, you should be fine with $1500 to $2000. The country is very diverse (geographically speaking) so there&#8217;s never a bad time to visit, it just depends on what you want to do. You will be heading in to the rainy season, so you might want to do further research on the Inca Trail. I believe it closes for a little while in Jan/Feb &#8211; so best to book your tour ahead of time (if this is something you want to do).

Like most countries, Peru is safe for solo travel but you do need to stay aware of your surroundings (I would say the same thing for Paris or New York). Travel during the day, stay alert at tourist hot spots, stay in hostels and join fellow travellers, etc. You&#8217;ll be fine. It&#8217;s an interesting country!

Hi! We&#8217;re backpacking through South America and are currently in ecuador heading down to Peru this weekend. Any recommendations on an itinerary if we&#8217;re traveling south? We definitely want to check out the Amazon but wonder if it&#8217;s better to do that first and then head to the coast or vice versa?


Thanks! Great site!

Hi Joy! Thanks for stopping by.

You can&#8217;t really go wrong with either direction. What I would do is travel down the coast to Huacachina, taking it slow and stopping along the way. Then go to Arequipa and Colca Canyon, then over to Puno and Lake Titicaca, then back up to Cusco, into the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu, then back to Cusco, then fly to Puerto Maldonado and do the Amazon. If you plan to head to Bolivia, you can go from Arequipa to Cusco and save Lake Titicaca for the end, then travel to Copacabana Bolivia.

Hope that helps! Sounds like an epic trip (we wish we were back there with you!)

How many days/nights do you advise staying at that Eco Lodge on the river? Looks amazing! I was thinking 2 nights? Is that enough to tour around?

Hi. We are planning to be in Peru for 2 weeks. Is this enough time to do all these things?

Also, is there a reliable tour operator that can put together an iternary for us?

How long do you suggest we spend in each place?


Many thanks

2 weeks should be enough time to visit most of these spots. 


We used G adventures for a tour that included a trip to the Amazon, Cusco, Inca trail hike, and Machu Picchu. You can extend that itinerary to include Lake Titicaca and the floating islands.

You do not mention the fabulous food in Peru. Best way to learn about it is a gastronomic tour of Lima. We have restaurants that make it into the top of the top 15 restaurants in the world. eg: http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Attraction_Review-g294316-d2358313-Reviews-The_Lima_Gourmet_Company-Lima_Lima_Region.html


And secondly you missed out on the music and dance of Peru. eg in Lima go to Las Brisas del Titicaca a fabulous show which starts late and ends way after midnight, but you must stay to the end or you will miss the Marinera Norte&#241;a! Lima also has fabulous shopping for everything Peruvian from low to expensive prices and of course the Gold Museum as well as beautiful colonial buildings to see.

Going to Peru on a backpacking trip with my 19 year old daughter and her friend. They are college kids and speak Spanish well. 10 day trip, 8 days in country this March. Must see Cusco,Titicaca and Machu Pichu. Staying in Hostels and going on the cheap but not afraid to spend to see the &#8220;must do&#8217;s&#8221;. Fly into Lima and heading out from there. Any thoughts on an itenerary as well as thoughts/ideas on hostels and whether we need reservations?

Hi Brian &#8211; sounds like an epic adventure!


8 days is not a lot of time to do much more than what you&#8217;ve already planned. 


So, if you do 1 day in Lima, then 2 days in Cusco to acclimate to the altitude, than 1 day in Machu Picchu, 1 day in the Sacred Valley (and/or travel day), then 1-2 days in Puno (Lake Titicaca), you will have to get back to Lima to fly home. 


Two places I would recommend are the Colca Canyon and Huacachina. But, the Colca Canyon will require at least two days (including travel time) and that will feel rushed.


So, what I would suggest you do is take a night bus from Puno to Ica (which is very close to Huacachina) and stay 1 night in the giant sand dunes. Then, catch a bus back to Lima (about 4-5 hours).


Here are a couple more photos of Huacachina:

Let me know if you need anything else, and make sure you come back and tell us how the trip went!

So we did it!!! Peru in 8 days. We skipped Lake Titicacca and went for Colca Canyon&#8230;Beautiful. It was a rush to squeeze in Machu Picchu, a couple days in Lima, a day in Arequipa, a day in Cusco, and a shopping trip to Pisac. We used evening buses for those long trips on the road and just kept going. Definitely want to go back to an eco-lodge in the Amazon. And&#8230;we climbed Machu Picchu Mountain&#8230;2 hours of stair-master type climbing to get to the top and then another hour to get down. However, the view is something you just can&#8217;t ignore. We were sore for a few days afterwards but just too awesome. We also tried all the best of the local foods and those little side resteraunts that have the &#8220;menu&#8221; for $8-$9 Soles for a salad, dish, desert and drink were a huge hit.

Those sand dunes are stunning &#8211; they look so.. perfect! I have always wanted to go to Peru. They have a pink freshwater dolphin that lives in the rivers (I know, sounds like folklore) there that I&#8217;d love to catch a glimpse of. Plus, the culture, climate and even the food.

Summer &#8211; Congrats! For peru, the main thing that might bother you is the altitude (it bothers a lot of people). Since it will be warm, make sure you always have bottled water with you. Also, try to stay away from any unusual food. It&#8217;s not really the best time to be trying a lot of new types of food. Other than that, have a great time! Oh, and be sure to get a checkup with the doctor before you go and call your insurance company. Make sure that you and the baby are fully covered and if not, buy extra coverage.

Hi Summer, 


I just read your comment. I have a trip planned to Peru in September and I will be about 24 weeks pregnant. Did you go on your trip? How did you deal with elevation? We wanted to do Colca Canyon but are a little worried about the elevation? Did you visit Colca Canyon? Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. &#8211; Jasmin

Hey and greetings from Norway!


Thank you for a good article with many great tips!


I am 21 year old and going to travel to Peru with my best friend from 10. july to 22. july this summer. We will do the classic inka trail from 17.-20. july, but the dates before the classic inka trail we are blank. 


Do you have any recommendations for to young travelers who want to see beautiful nature and exotic urban life in Peru? We will arrive Lima 10. july and must be in Cusco at 17. july. 


We prefer nature over city life and your tips was were tempting, but we have only a week without any plans to explore the country. Could it be smart to travel from Lima to Cusco over 7 days and explore the country, or could it be a little stressing? 


Do you have any recommendations for us? It would be very nice if so!


Best regards, 


Lars Martin Haugland

You could go to the Colca Canyon for a couple of days. Go first to Arequipa and then take a 2 day tour from there to the canyon. Arequipa is a city but the canyon is not. Also&#8230;if you are hiking the trail starting July 17th then you want to arrive in Cusco a couple days earlier than the 17th. So you really only have 5 days to work within and the travel requires some time and planning.

Hi Lars,


You could always fly from Cusco to Puerto Maldonado and go into the Amazon jungle. It could be done in 3/4 days since you need to fly in and out. Then you could make your way to Cusco for the hike. Or, you could make your way from Lima to Huacachina by bus, spend a couple days sandboarding, then continue by bus to start your Inca trail hike. Or, do as Brian suggest below. Have a great time on the trip!

Just a note to say Peru has a north too and equal to the south for things to do a see, try Pacasmayo 100km north of Trujillo, I live there 6 mths of the year, feel free to contact me if your going to Peru and would like some direction in the north.

That&#8217;s a tough one because there&#8217;s a lot to do! With kids, I would recommend Huacachina and Lake Titicaca. You can catch a bus from Cusco to Puno and then explore the floating reed islands on Lake Titicaca. Then, catch a bus from Puno to Ica, which is only 15 minutes to Huacachina. Kids will love the sand dunes and the dune buggies. Most hostels and hotels have pools too.

Is Peru overall safe? I&#8217;m planning on going in a few years after I graduate high school, and I won&#8217;t be alone, but I&#8217;ll most likely be with only my mother, maybe my brother. Would you recommend it for a high school graduate? I&#8217;m mostly concerned about the safety, above all things. And how long do you suggest the trip last? I want to make the trip long enough to see all that I want to see, but not too long. I was thinking between 2-3 weeks? It will probably be the biggest trip I&#8217;ll ever go on for a very long time. Thanks for the post!

Hi Grace

I have lived there off and on for 10 years now and never had an incident, as in most places in the world though there is crime so I would say to not flash money and use a lot of common sense and you will be just fine, enjoy your trip and you will have a lot of fun.

The driving in Peru is definitely very different. I don&#8217;t know where you are used to driving but following stop signals, stop signs, speed limits, etc. are not a strong suit for Peruvian drivers! We just got home last week after our 7.5 week trip and we rented a car (with driver) one time to get out somewhere that was pretty remote and where buses did not go. It was very affordable, especially if you have 4 or more people!

Great article, since we ourselves travel to some degree, i would be interested in your opinion of travelling to the region booking local condos and booking everything locally rather then through a travel agent here in Canada. When booking packages I find that in some cases they include things that are not of interest to us. Any comment that may be helpful would be greatly appreciated. We plan on going mid to late april.

Yes, we went to the Amazon while on the G Adventure tour. Here&#8217;s a link for South America tours &#8211; http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-4139033-11044806

I believe we did the &#8220;Classic&#8221; Peru trip, the one that includes the flights to Amazon plus Machu Picchu. We left the group in Cusco though and traveled overland to Puno (floating reed islands), Arequipa, Ica (Huacachina), Nazca and then back to Lima.

Your info is fascinating. I want to bring my granddaughters and daughter and I there. I will contact gadventures. Are hostels pretty cheap there? What is average meal cost? Since I will be paying for the four of us I need to know how much to plan for in costs. Are there a lot of entry fees? Tipping? Tour fees? Bus costs are low? Would cost be prohibitive to hire a tour guide or couple to accompany us?

Hi Carol &#8211; hostels are relatively cheap in Peru. Cusco is quite popular, so prices will be a little higher. When we were there we spent about $25 per night for a private double room. I don&#8217;t remember if there was a lot of entry fees. We were on tour so I assume some of the costs were covered by the tour operator. Buses can be very cheap, but I&#8217;d recommend the first class tourist buses. Still a great value for what you get. You can travel around Peru without a tour guide but it will require more planning on your part. Joining a tour will certainly make things more convenient, which may be worth it given the 3 generations you&#8217;ll be traveling with. Have fun! Come back and tell us how the trip went.

Hello, I cant believe how excited I am. I was born and raised in Lima but moved to the states when I was 17. never really went out of Lima and now I&#8217;m planning taking my children back home to explore my beautiful country but even I, did not know where to start. thank you so much for all the information. I can&#8217;t wait to take my whole family to explore and see where we come from.

Hi,

my friend and I are planning an expedition to Peru as part of a scouting award and we&#8217;re trying to piece together as much information as possible for the trip as it has to be self guided.

We were wondering whether you had any information about things to do? All we seemed to find were places to visit which is great but we&#8217;re trekking for 10 days and would like to find things to do along the way.

As well as this cheap but friendly accommodation ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks! &#128578;

Hi Melissa &#8211; where will you be trekking? That will dictate what you can do and where you should stay. Accommodations are still quite cheap if you get outside the touristy areas and you&#8217;re comfortable without the modern conveniences of home (ie. staying in hostel or guest houses where you share bathroom, linen is old, no tv&#8217;s, etc.)

My husband and I will be travelling to Peru in September. We have 3 weeks set a side to explore. We are looking at tour companies and also considering going on our own. I see that G Adventures and Gap have been mentioned previously and I&#8217;m wondering if any one has traveled with Manu Expedition, if so how would you rate them. All posts have been very informative. We would like to include Easter Island in this 3 week period. Any info on this side trip would be helpful eg: booking a flight to Easter Island from Peru and how much time should we allow.

What would reasonable budget be for 3 weeks in Peru seeing the majority of the sites.

Thanks for reaching out Jaye. I have not used or heard of Manu Expedition, so I can&#8217;t comment about them.

When we visited Easter Island the only way to get there from South America was from Santiago, Chile. We flew with LAN airlines.

We only spent 4 days in Easter Island and could have easily spent another week there. There&#8217;s a lot to do &#8211; hiking, volcanoes, beaches, scuba diving and, of course, checking out all the moai statues.

Reasonable budget for 3 weeks in Peru will depend greatly on what you do and how you do it. I would need to understand your goals, travel style and the destinations you plan to visit.

I am traveling to Peru this Summer for my third visit. I would add Arequipa to your list, especialky if visiting Colca Canyon. Arequipa, the White City (much of &#8220;white&#8221; is Volcanic Ash used in buildings) is a fascinating place. The Volcano Misti gives the city particularly beautiful scenes. Arequipa&#8217;s Plaza is wonderful &amp; Castalia moisture is very interesting. Actually the Amazon begins in Arequipa.

Agreed that besides Machu Picchu being a spectacular site there is so more to Peru. Even if one doesn&#8217;t make it to Machu Picchu with it&#8217;s way overpriced tours ripping off thousands of tourists everyday.In Bolivia there is Pre inca Tiwanaku near LaPaz that dates back to nearly 20,000 years, many scientist s believe that it&#8217;s precise carving of the stone temples were possibly built my aliens. Colca Canyon, Arequipa, Lima, Nazca Lines. Iquitos, Puno/Lake Titicaca, Cuzco.With all the tourists it seems like an overblown tourist trap like the Eiffel Tower or Statue of Liberty

Thank you for all your great recommendations! I am just planning a trip to Peru and came across your site and it has me excited to try out some of your ideas. I am joining friends for the typical MP trip &#8211; but then they leave the country and head home. I am now going to add more time to my trip so I can get to see more of Peru as it all sounds so interesting.

Great overview of some of the overlooked sites in Peru! We are planning on traveling there at the end of the summer with our two boys and are rating what the best activities are for traveling with them. MP is guaranteed, and Colca Canyon would be amazing.

Hi! Found your article really interesting! I&#8217;m going to Peru this June and really want to go to the Amazon. The way which you did it sounds really interesting. I&#8217;m assuming you got from Cusco to Puerto Maldonado by plane. Did you organize the 3 hour boat trip once you got there? What company did you book through for the lodges you stayed at? What did you do once you were in the Amazon?

Any help is really appreciated!

Thanks,

Lucie

Hi!Is the route to hike the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu is very rough? Me and my partner want to do it but I am not sure because I am scared of high and just can&#8217;t be on the edge

Thanks in advance Anna

Flying into Lima in Early Feb and out of Buenos Aires start of March so having a 3 week holiday. I am wanting to fit as uch as possible into the trip ad from what you have described up top I would lim ego do Machu Picchu Day trip which in reality is probably a 3 day turn around and I would like to fit sand boarding, Amazon jungle and Lake Titicacca in. What would you suggest as an itinerary keeping in mind I will still need to see things in Bolivia and Argentina before flying out?

Hi I just read your article above. I am planning a trip in a few weeks and had a question. If I don&#8217;t do the Inca Trail would I still an amazing experience like the others describe? I would love to do it but due to medical reasons I have to skip the long hike.

I am planning a group trip to Prue, and I get to plan the trip, it will be next may or june?.

There will be approximately 20 to 30 fathers and sons from 12 years of age to adult. We would like we will lonely have 7 to 8 days to include travel. Machu Picchu is a must, what else is a must-see that has a lot cultural experience. We want to give our sons a once in a life time father son experience as well

Thanks Tim
