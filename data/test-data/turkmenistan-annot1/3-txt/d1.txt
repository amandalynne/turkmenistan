<font>Popular tourist places in Turkmenistan.  Turkmenistan Tourism Destinations</font>


National Park of Independence
 
The main tourist sight of the capital of Turkmenistan is National Park of Independence with the symbol of modern Ashgabat established on it - the Monument of Independence, the highest construction in the country (local people call it "Eight-leg"). 
The basis of this snow-white monument is the hemisphere serving as symbolical image of a traditional Turkmen yurta. Rivers-fountains flow down all eight "feet" of a dome-yurta and partially on its surface...


Monument of Neutrality in Ashgabat
 
Interesting object for visiting in Ashkhabad is Monument of Neutrality which has been reopened in December, 2011 located for now in a southern part of Ashkhabad, on Bitarap Turkmenistan Avenue - a passage of the largest highway.

Seyit Jemaletdin Mosque
 
Seyit Jemaletdin Mosque. Among the small number of Timurids-era monuments on the territory of Turkmenistan the mosque of Seyit Jemaletdin in Anau was the most brilliant. According to inscriptions on its facades and interior it was built when Khoresm was ruled by Abu Kasim Baber Bahadurhan (1446/1457).

Kow-Ata. Father of Caves
 
Kow-Ata Underground Lake is located in Baharly (formerly Bakharden) in the foothills of the Kopet-Dag Mountains (107 km to the west of Ashgabat). The Turkmen name, Kow-Ata, means "father of caves".

Mausoleum of Mane Baba
 
Mausoleum is situated in a small village named Mane in the Kahka region of Turkmenistan. It was built during the reign of the Seljuk Empire in the 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> centuries. This mausoleum was constructed over the grave of the famous follower of Sufism and great philosopher of Eastern literature, Abu Said Maneyi, who lived from 968-1049. It was built in approximately the mid-11<sup>th</sup> century. In his early childhood, Abu Said began his education.

Mausoleum of Il-Arslan
 
Mausoleum of Il-Arslan is connected with the name of Fakhr-ad-din Razi, a scientist who died in Herat in 1208.

The mausoleum presents a small, almost square structure, crowned by a twelve-sided marquee. The eastern facade and door has beautiful decorative trim, made of ornamental masonry of baked brick...


Mausoleum of Sultan Tekesh
 
Tekesh was the 12<sup>th</sup> century Khorezm Shah who made Khorezm great with conquests as far away as Khorosan (present day northern Iran and Afghanistan). He built this mausoleum for himself, along with a large madrassah and library (which has not survived) on the same spot. After his death in 1200 he was buried here...


Minaret of Kutlug Timur
 
The revival of Khorezm and its capital city, literally from the ashes, is connected with the name of its Golden Horde governor - General Kutlug Timur (1321-1335) and his wife, Turabek Khanym. The Minaret of Kutlug Timur is the tallest minaret in Central Asia. Its height is 62 m, and is decorated with bands of brick and a few remaining turquoise tiles. 145 winding steps lead to the top of the minaret. This is one of the more impressive points in Kunya-Urgench...

Margiana, margush&#8230; what is coorect?
 
Margiana&#8230; What is the source of this stirring name, which has entered history textbooks as a symbol of the buried mysteries of time? It is no idle saying that sooner or later every mystery gains an explanation. At the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century A.D., almost four thousand years later, an enigmatic Margiana, which is stuck in its descendants' memories only owing to the angry words of Darius I, carved on a famous Behistun cliff: "The country of Margush became rebellious..", has not only come back from oblivion but found its own true place in mankind's development...


Old and New Nissa
 
Nisa, the ancient Nicaea, the capital of Parthaunisa and a sacred city. A royal fortress built in the mid-2<sup>nd</sup> century Av.JC. fortress at Nisa was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007. Nisa is described by some as one of the first capitals of the Parthians.
